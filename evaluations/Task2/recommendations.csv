I am not a sushi eater.  You may tie me to the whipping post now.  My husband, however, LOVES sushi.  He would like nothing better than to live in Japan again.  And I will say he is very impressed with Dozo.Since our relationship is not all about me, I allow him to take me to dinner here once for every 20 times I make him eat Mexican food.  And I admit, I always enjoy it too.  They have a great menu in addition to sushi.  I always have a combination which is tempura with your choice of entree.  Fantastic tempura every time.  I've tried the katsu chicken, terriyaki salmon, and plum chicken as well.  Service is excellent.  The servers actually seem to appreciate your business and the sushi chef always thanks us as we are leaving even though we're not sitting at the sushi bar.  Relaxed, casual atmosphere.  No need to ho up to come here.  Very enjoyable."

Since then it has become a signature dish in my heart and I've gone out of my to find restaurants whose reputations are tied to this savory dish from the sea.  I was excited when I recently read a piece in Phoenix Magazine lauding the ceviche of Salvadoreno as one of the essential dishes of the valley.  I soon headed east to determine whether or not this dish would rival my favorite versions of the dish; the beach side shack outside of Topolobompo and the Halibut Ceviche of the Foundry Grill up at Sundance in Utah.We were greeted by the friendly yet chaotic smile that it so common with Latin American dives.  We quickly ordered some horchata, very strong, and some pupusas, above average, before we prepared to dine the reason for our visit.I certainly wasn't disappointed.  My only real hang up was their interpretation of what a portion should be.  The dish could serve 4 people without a problem.  The ingredients were standard to ceviche and all tasted very fresh.  The only slight difference was that the shrimp on top were grilled.  We finished the meal with Nuegados de Yuca con miel, fried but not too heavy, and called it a meal.  While it wasn't the best ceviche it was certainly among the top tier.  The restaurant is just close enough to warrant a semi regular visit.  A great place that deserves your attention.  Just remember that when you order the ceviche bring a friend or three along for the ride."

We had a cheese tasting simply because I *never* pass up Pleasant Ridge Reserve when given the opportunity.  They also choose a lovely soft sheep's milk and an herbed goat cheese from Cypress Grove.  Nice work but pricey -- only two slices of baguette and apple!  I had the romaine salad -- should have gone with a sandwich and the delicious looking truffle fries!  The feta and red pepper dressing were just too salty and rich for 1pm.  I spied a number of delicious looking sandwiches from my table...Service was great and the waiter even went out of his way to answer a couple questions about the cheese selection.

Growing up in Chicago, it was hard for me to find a Greek spot that I really enjoyed, but have found exactly what I was looking for at King Gyros. The owners are always so kind, and welcoming, and there is always just a great atmosphere every time I stop by. Most people can not taste the difference with Gyros, but I have to say they have the best Gyro meat. Their tzatziki sauce is probably one of my favorite things about the place. It just makes everything better! Their Chicken Pita sandwich is also always amazing. Their spices and ingredients are what makes their restaurant stand out. I will continue to come to king gyros while I live in Phoenix at least once a week. Go and try it out for yourselves, I promise you will not be disappointed!"

All of the menu items are very reasonably priced and relative to the portion sizes.The only downside of this location is the decor. It is clearly a successful restaurant and they should invest in some better seating. It looks rather trashy on the inside, but then again, maybe that is part of its charm."

As promised, the food is super fresh Tuscan style food. I believe he said ""Farm to table"" and he was dead on. The Burratta on toasts was excellent followed by the meatballs that my husband loved. We had the special and loved it. My husband is a definite meat and potatoes kind of guy and was looking forward to the traditional steak house appetizers from the place originally planned. But....he love the food at Solo Trattoria and we also loved trying a new family owned Phoenix business in the Biltmore area. I wish for their sake, they were on the beaten path, but I promise that if you take the extra walk through the tunnel or do the valet or the huge parking garage, you won't be disappointed with Solo Trattoria on the west side of the traditional Biltmore shops!"

There are orange trees and heaters and the waiters are extremely attentive.Now let's get to the good part..the FOOD :)We had a ton of appetizers - shrimp, chicken and veggies and all were really good.

It really is like having a personal trainer since every workout is planned out for you via screen and it also picks appropriate weight levels.

As a beginner, I am pretty uneducated when it comes to my guitar. My guitar teacher suggested I get the action lowered on my guitar so I called around town trying to get quotes and time frames on such a procedure. Unfortunately, I did not have very good experiences calling various places around town. But, fortunately, I was referred to Upper Bout by two experienced guitarists and I decided to pop in on my lunch break today. I had no idea what to expect, but the minute I walked into the store, I was greeted warmly and was surprised that they fixed my guitar right on the spot! Ricky was amazing. He took the time to explain to me each and every thing he was doing to my guitar, educated me on various aspects regarding the make of guitar, and even eased my concerns about the scary noises my guitar was making as he made adjustments. As if that wasn't enough, he made my guitar sing AND the price was totally reasonable (especially compared to many of the places I called)! I was so incredibly pleased with the experience that I will continue to refer people here and will continue to take them my business. Thank you to Ricky and The Upper Bout for the good experience! You guys are great and I will be spreading the word!"

First off, when you walk through the door, someone friendly is always there to greet you and make sure you are taking care of. Second, the place is so colorful with so many new magazines, hair books, products to look at I hardly even sit on my phone. Third, I go see Krissy Moore for my haircuts. She is AMAZING in so many ways, not only talented at cutting hair, but has an awesome sensor or humor, a friendly positive attitude, and always does a phenomenal job!!! She and I have become good friends because of it! I look forward to getting my haircuts there, even though it is a drive from where I live. I recently moved to Flagstaff, Arizona, so for me- this commute is a 2 hour driving distance. I don't care! She does such a great job, I make an appointment way in advance so I can schedule in the time to make the drive. Worth every second!!

Just register for the shows you fancy and if there is space, you'll get a confirmation email. Turn up early as more emails are issued than they have capacity for as there are always no shows and they want bums on seats.Venue inside is spacious enough - lighting and sound is great and no obstruction views for what I could see. Even queuing is civilised as you get in based on your ticket number e.g.. 1-10, 11-30, etc. Even getting there early is ok - fake grass, bar serving the usual options and prices not to horrific (å£4.50 for G&T - Hendricks).Good range of acts on from tasters of well known comedians and acts to kids stuff.

Another unique feature, they're open till 3 a.m.We happened to discover this place while researching for places with extended late hours and ox tail soup. Photos and familiarity of other Yelp diners provided positive detail.Didn't try the oxtail noodle soup as had initially thought. Too hard to pass up the Hue Spicy Beef Noodle as it might allude to some of us that it's Bun Bo Hue... but it's not. Doesn't include tamarind shavings,  blood cubes or a pig's knuckle. Suggest the meats be added last to avoid over cooking. Still a very filling and satisfying spicy noodle soup experience. Three meats rice dish of grilled pork, beef kalbi plus sweet lop cheung with hot steaming white rice was definitely a ""haven't eaten all day"" filler up meal. The egg on top of the rice is an ""ohana"" touch. Oyster sauce and drop of sesame oil would have taken the house down. LoLWill be back for more."

Depending on the show or event, there are (or aren't) a fair number of tables. No matter what, though, there's a padded bench that lines about a quarter of the space. That's a nice place to park and take in a show, provided you can get to the club early enough to get a seat.There's a fairly small menu, but since this is a concert venue first and foremost that makes sense. I've had chili and sandwiches there before, and everything was above average. People seem to really dig their pizza, too, which always looks when I see a steaming pie drift past. There are usually lots of good craft and imported beers either on tap or bottled, and they whip up some mean mixed drinks. Fair wine list too, if that's your bag. Service can get a little chaotic once music starts, but that doesn't bother me too much.Club Cafe usually attracts smaller bands, from local Pittsburgh acts to national indie artists. Some higher-profile names sell out quickly (Sufjan Stevens right around the time of his Illinoise release, for instance), other modestly popular acts still draw a large crowd (Richard Buckner, to use an example from a couple of years ago, or Wovenhand). One of my qualms with the place is that the club's in-house sound set-up always seems pushed to its limit with distorted electric guitars. The stage is also small enough that any band that has more than three people looks like they're trying not to knock their bandmates over. One problem I always have with Club Cafe--and I get that this might be a ""it's me, not you"" kind of thing--is that there's ALWAYS at least one incredibly loud person doing their best to ruin a show. I guess they get plastered before the show at the bar and then buy a ticket so they can keep drinking? I realize that talking to your friends is fun, but come on...other people are trying to watch the show! This has happened the last six shows I've been to. Pittsburgh people tend to be polite, so usually no one says anything...including the staff. THAT is what frustrates me."

Surprised.Never thought I would see a ramen place excel higher than monta. Well, this place is pretty damn close. Keep it up and I would say they finally raised the bar for ramen in this town! Their broth (tonkatsu premium white) is less salty, thick and creamy. It sits well in your stomach. It doesn't feel fattening, and is really light. When you eat it, it goes down so smooth and you don't feel humongous after you eat a bowl. You simply feel satisfied.Get the combos for more for your buck! Awesome prices. Chasu bowls are really good. The Jinya bun is suuuuper yummy I could eat those all day.The atmosphere is awesome. Nice setting. Loud music. When you walk in they immediately greet you hello. When you walk out they immediately greet you goodbye. You feel like you're a famous someone, and that's an awesome feeling! The waitresses are super sweet! She even remembered me after just two visits. This place is definitely a hot spot. Their girls bathroom is also pretty awesome. And I love the fact that they're open late til 3am.

I will say this the quality is on point and they know how to make sushi but I'm probably not coming back anytime soon because what we had wasn't memorable. I think what would help this place is to make something nobody else makes and put it on the menu as a special! It could help but still no complaints here

And it was close to my house. Recently opened (within the past week), I came home from work to find a menu and coupon for a free order of sweet potato tots under my door. That definitely gets me in.I got take out. Free tots and 12 bone in wings. They have a bunch of flavors like different heat level buffalo sauces and some new flavors like sweet chili garlic. I got Honey BBQ and Oriental sesame. These wings were great for bone in. Tons of meat on the bone, crispy, and both flavors were great. The tots were crispy and good. I want to go back and try their all you can eat wing deal. They also have boneless wings and burgers on the menu. http://www.chickenbonz.com/menu.html They also have free wi-fi.

Also not to miss is the spring rolls. At first sight I was a little weirded out as they looked (and felt) like *ahem* something you may find at the Le Castle Boutique, but that's just how spring rolls are (chef boyfriend says technically they are summer rolls, as spring rolls are fried). But they are TASTY. Peanut sauce, crunchy fresh veggies, fat shrimp. MMMMMMMM I want some right now. Last, you MUST get the Vietnamese coffee! You brew it yourself in the cutest little contraption that drips right into a tiny glass of calorie-free sweetened condensed milk. It IS calorie free, right? RIGHT?!

Whenever we walked by the place was packed but we were told that it would only be a 10 minute wait.  Less than 5 minutes later we were in and seated.  The inside of the place was cool, done mostly in wood and there was an Irish band playing like there is every night after 9.For dinner my girlfriend and I decided to start off by splitting the goat cheese salad and beer cheese dip.  The salad was pretty refreshing as it had a vinaigrette dressing with a nice big hunk of goat cheese on top of it.  However it paled in comparison to the beer cheese dip which came served with some crackers and bread.  Man was that stuff good and very cheesy!  You could even taste the hint of Smithwick's that went into it. For my entree I decided on the bangers and mash since we were at an Irish place.  It came with two links of sausage covered in a mushroom sauce covering the mashed potatoes which in turn were covered with cabbage.  My favorite part of my entree was the mashed potatoes which had some mustard seed in it which gave it a nice taste.  Other than that the rest of my entree was also good.The bottom line for me is that I would head back here in the future but before the live band starts at 9 PM.  You see the state of NV has an 18%+ sales tax on all food and drinks when there is live entertainment or so our waiter explained to me.  So while I enjoyed the food and atmosphere that definitely left a sour taste in my mouth."

I mean where on God's green earth does a macho bartender introduce himself when you approach the bar to buy a beer?!!The decor, although dated, is wonderfully nostalgic. The music, one of the best parts, is both old-school (who plays The Beach Boys?!), and new catchy songs. The clientele is a mix of young-ish, middle age, and mature--all friendly, no-attitude, and inviting. Met the nicest duo (friends/biz partners). I can't remember the last time strangers invited me for a drink and were so down-to-earth. Suggestions: close the damn doors. I ""get"" the inviting look of open doors at places of biz, but it was too cold unless one sat in the middle of the place. I don't get why all bars do this. Otherwise, I'm a huge fan.

It is a world away from the strip and non-smoking and does not have a casino.  It also does not have a large restaurant selection, although it is Vegas.  I had a suite on the north side (stay on the north side, it is cooler in the summer).  Wonderful beds, comfy and cozy.  Great checkin, but I had to wait 16.32 minutes on hold for the bell desk to answer and they said my luggage would be up in 5 minutes, but was closer to 9 in real time.

Very skeptical.  One might even say scared.  Other Yelp reviewers have torn this place apart.  But the hubby had his heart set on Oscar Goodman's name sake, and so we made reservations and went for Valentine's Day.  And in all honesty I really enjoyed myself!  I'm not sure why some other horrendous reviews.Yes, my review is long, but I'm trying to help others.  Here's how I see it:Service:  2 1/2 stars. While I hope Oscar's management takes my whole review to heart, this is the area they need to take most seriously.  Our waiter was nice enough, but not the best I've ever had.  Both the hostesses (those at the front desk who check in reservations and those that seat guests) and bussing staff were, well, lackluster--hard to get a read either way.  Quite honestly the two best staff members I met during the evening was the general manager circulating the room and our food runner who always came by with a smile.  To those complaints from other reviewers that say their waiter was never seen between order and bill-- apparently we didn't dine at the same restaurant, because friendly or not, all the staff was present.  I will agree however that all of the staff could use an afternoon seminar on smiling and saying ""Yes.""Food:  3 1/2 stars.  The food itself was more like 4 stars (I am clueless what poor reviewers have been eating--most everything we had was wonderful), but the menu selection gets them ""knocked down"" a 1/2 if not a full star in my book.  I've never been to a steakhouse that doesn't have at least one pasta dish on the menu, and because I'm not a steak fan (hubby is a fanatic) the pasta is what I always order.  However, Oscar's does not have a single one.  When I inquired of the waiter if a pasta request could be accomodated (I know they share a kitchen with sister restaurant Italian ""Simpatico,"" so this shoudn't be impossible.) he stated that I could see a Simpatico menu, but if I wanted to order off that, we would have to be re-seated in that room.  That's ridiculous!  My husband wants the Oscar's menu, and we both want appetizers and desserts from your menu, all I'm asking for is a pasta entree from the kitchen.  I had already even viewed the Simpatico menu and was going to order one of the most expensive dishes!  (Pricier than what I ended up ordering off Oscar's real menu, oh well, your loss of a bigger check, Mr. Waiter.)  Anyway, I pieced together a dinner for myself.  I started with the lobster bisque--5 stars!  It was atypical an delicious!  It has large pieces of lobster in it, which I've never been served before when I order the dish at other restaurants.  Then I had the crab cake ""appetizer"" as my entree and a side of sweet potato fries.  4 1/2 stars for the crab cakes--very little filler and lots of lump crab meat.  3 1/2 stars on the fries--delicious, and they sprinkle them generously with a cinnamon sugar mixture.  My husband started with the caesar salad, and then the cedar planked salmon and a baked potato.  In his words, all three items were solid 4's.  And we both agreed--the free onion bread--5 stars all the way!!!!  My disappointment was dessert.  We ordered the triple chocolate mousse (which the food runner called triple chocolate cake as he delivered it, so the house doesn't even know what it is) and it arrived still partly frozen.  Sorry, Oscar's, but please jump off the ""thawed-pre-made-desserts"" bandwagon and make your own.  Even if you specialized in just one or two and could recommend those to the customers and the rest were pre-made.Decor and Ambience:  4 1/2 stars.  Near perfect.  ""Old School Vegas"" as my husband calls it, and what we were both hoping for.  So many places here in Las Vegas nowadays are some hip interior designer's idea of ""new and fancy.""  That has it's place and time, don't get me wrong, but I really do enjoy occasionally going to a place that makes me feel like I've stepped back in time.  Oscar's is definitely upscale, and has fashionable decor with it's faux-croc upholstered booths, and metallic chairs and couches, but still feels classic, and cliche as it may be, like I said, ""old school.""  My only caveat is the way the music ""competes.""  There is a live piano player in the bar, which is great for that area's ambience.  However, they play canned music in the dining room, and because the restaurant is not huge, when dining you hear both.  This not only makes for an overly loud atmosphere that makes hearing the waiter and your dining companion hard, but is annoying due to the two different battling tunes.  If anything, Oscar's, I would skip the piped music.Final note-- The floating ""Broads"": Unnecessary and tacky.  They didn't approach us, I'm assuming because it was Valentine's Day, but they were there.  And I just find it insulting that Oscar's believes these women are appropriate for a restaurant that should be catering to couples with quite a bit of money to spend on a nice date night out."

Well, on a hot triple digit afternoon I decided to take the fam after telling them that these guys have the Dole Pineapple Whip. As soon as they heard that they couldnt get here fast enough.After about some lengthy driving......we finally make it! I was thinking were going to Boulder City after a while for it was literally only a couple more miles up the freeway. The last time we had Dole Pineapple Whip was at a stand inside Disneyland just in front of the Enchanted Tiki Room. This fro you they have here tastes just like it. Now if they would only sell pineapple juice and pineapple spears.......Just like any other fro yo place, they have all sorts of toppings at your disposal. One thing I noticed that stood out was that you can get a layer of waffle cone for your cup. Whatever you decide, you pay for total weight in ounces. After getting 3 nice sized cups, the bill came out to about 15 bucks. I would say that's about average.I like the ambience of the place. Looks like place you can hang out and shoot the breeze with your friends while having some fro yo. For those old school video gamers, they actually have a some upright video games in the back called the family room. No quarters needed. Just hit start and off you go! They have Pac Man and Donkey Kong! The other upright one was a mix of about 10 old school games as well but you gotta play it on a really tiny screen. The only thing that was a downer was that the joystick for the Pac Man game was not working correctly meaning that whatever direction you want your Pac Man to go, didnt always went that way. Yeah, I hate it whenever my joystick goes in different directions. Just ask my wife. Lol. Oh well, its free so no complaints right?Overall, its not a bad place to hang out. I just dont wanna drive all the way across town and virtually into Boulder City for some fro yo unless I or my wife was really craving it. Btw, they dont take American Express.Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #155 ""Pineapple fro yo ftw!"""

Back in the day I would only go when a band I really wanted to see was playing. Back in those days I don't think they even HAD any taps LOL. Food was a guy that had a hot dog cart right outside the bar. But hey - it's come a long long way since then. Now I even come to the non-band side where they serve food and craft beers even if I'm NOT planning to see a band. Came with a bunch of coworkers the other day for happy hour. A good time was had by all. They even have one of those Touch Tunes jukeboxes and I took it over for the time we were all there. I had to supress laughter when one of the coworkers claimed ""they play pretty good music here."" They never figured it out even though every time that someone was wondering out loud what song was playing I just happened to know each time - even if their Shazams couldn't figure it out. The only complaint is the craft beer/food side of the Yucca was a lot hotter than the other side. I'll admit I'm not a big fan of the mall it's in. I usually enter from Mill but now one of the entrances to the mall is blocked off by poles planted into the ground so there is only that one main entrance now. Lots of parking - yeah it's sketchy but further into the night the Yucca is eventually the only business open.

I cannot remember her name, but she is the short, bubbly, brunette who is from Puerto Rico and previously worked at Bouchon in Las Vegas.  Her passion and enthusiasm for your food is infectious.  I have never met anyone who loves what they do more than this chef.

So...why four stars you ask? Well...this is one of those cases where I have to consider consistency; and we've only been here once...so after a couple more visits, more than likely I'll be tacking on that coveted 5th star. We checked this place out the other night and first thing I have to mention is that it was dead...the whole time we were there nobody else came in...which is scary; as others have mentioned, a place like this should be a mad house with the type of food they're serving up...God forbid someone from Cocoa's (which is next to it) actually grew some taste buds and walked over there for some real food. Anyway, I'll get off my high horse...here is what we tried:-Chips/Salsa - Chips tasted fresh...both salsas they brought out were very flavorful. One of them which I believe was the roasted salsa was basically just a chunky mash up of roasted peppers and onions and was spicy heaven in a cup.-Carne Asada Tacos - Wow. Seriously...MY GOD. This is probably the best carne asada I've ever had. Tender, flavorful, glorious toppings...served on a soft and fluffy flour tortilla...foodgasm. -Barbacoa Tacos - Melt in your mouth good...just like the carne asada taco's I pretty much didn't know what to say after biting into it, it left me speechless.-Quesadilla w/ Carne Asada - They used three different types of cheeses...that combined with the tasty tortilla and flavorful carne asada made this yet another winner. God was cruel to me and made me allergic to avocado...so I didn't get to try the guacamole, but Katrina thought it was great. Overall, we were just very impressed with this place and can't wait to go back. The owner even came over and talked to us for a bit about how the food is made fresh daily, and she seemed very proud of the way she cooks, it was inspiring...and it helps that she was super friendly and personable. I really really hope this place succeeds like it deserves to. 4.5/5."

If yo are taking kids I advise the Thunderbird Park area by the amphitheater .It's very low key , wide and without alot of obstacles. East of that area you can hike or drive over to Electra Dr. and hike the other peak. Across Pinnacle Peak is another option with a large lot to park in. It is a rocky trail but most adults can handle it. Most weekend mornings and evenings there are quite large groups hiking and walking.

It is located right by the Miracle Mile shops inside Planet Hollywood hotel and casino. I had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. They text you when they are ready for you which I thought was awesome-way better than the beepers they give you at other restaurants. They also gave you an Ipad to order your drinks and desserts on which I thought was a nice touch. I had a hard time choosing what burger to get because they all sounded so good! I ended up getting the Euro Burger because it had goat cheese and I loveee love goat cheese! We also got the sweet potato fries. Both were amazing! The sweet potato fries came with powered sugar and a jalapeno  mayo sauce that completed both flavors veryy well. The burger was great! I loved the goat cheese on it. We were also lucky enough to try the jalapeno poppers because the next table over gave us one to try! They were fabulous and the sauce it came with was awesome. I also tried the chocolate caramel pudding milkshake. I recommend this as well. It came with homemade whipped cream and a cookie on top. I've never had pudding with a milkshake so it made it unique and was a selling point for me. Next time I go back I want to try the push pops because those looked delicious as well! The service was good. I think our waitress was new but she was friendly. We didn't have to wait long for our food which is always great for me.

To top it off, we enjoyed the freshest baklava I've had in a decade with a perfect cup of Turkish coffee (with a touch of cardamon). Authentic, fresh, unbeatable Middle Eastern food!

However, I did find an awesome pink patent Marc Jacobs tote that was quite affordable...averitable bargain for Barneys.The service was awesome...the salesgal who helped me was amazing, she went in the back 3-4 times to look for various Bbag colors or styles, and when I left with the $120 bag instead of the $1200 bag, she was still chipper and friendly.

Thus, we actually PREFER a hotel with no casino in it. I got a Travelzoo rate several months ago for $109/nt for a King Suite with a view.When we arrived, check-in was VERY efficient and speedy. Our room was on the 55th floor and we had a view straight down the Strip. The room was spacious and had a well-equipped kitchenette (including Sub Zero mini fridge, Bosch microwave and Cuisinart toaster and blender). The bathroom had a huge marble shower and separate Jacuzzi bathtub, double marble sinks and a flatscreen TV INSIDE of the mirror! The furnishings are very clean and modern and the room felt luxurious.The best part of the entire room was the bed! It was easily the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in -- IN MY LIFE! The front desk told me they are made by Stearns & Foster specially for Mr. Trump, but that he thinks something similar is available through the company. The sheets were high TC and the pillows and comforter were lofty and plump. The hotel also offers a 4 p.m. late checkout for no additional charge, which was perfect since we were out until 4 a.m. the night before.My complaints are extremely minor: no call-down service for the valet (but the wait was usually only about 10 minutes), no free WiFi ($12/day is a little steep and I felt it should have been included), no additional toiletries like mouthwash or toothpaste and the shampoo/conditioner wasn't very high quality. Boyfriend also thought there should be some sort of rubber mat for the shower, since it was all marble and was very slippery once wet. My only other comment is that the lobby is a little bit gauche (but, it's Vegas...what lobby isn't?!).All in all, I thought this was a FANTASTIC value and, as I said, the best bed I've experienced in my life. I will definitely be back.p.s. in response to those who say it's ""off the Strip,"" it's not. It's on the older part of the Strip (near Circus Circus), but it's not technically ""off-Strip.""  Also, when it's 110 degrees outside, I don't know who is actually WALKING from casino to casino, anyway!!! Seriously? Doesn't everyone take a cab everywhere?"

Really, any troupe of acrobats could do that.It's not like Ka.  Only Cirque du Soleil could do Ka.  All the athleticism, stunts and choreography is integral to the narrative and the telling of the story.It's still good and worth seeing especially if you get Tix For Tonight, but it's the weakest of the Cirque shows in Vegas.

The first few times I had the pizza, we had ordered it to our office, so I hadn't been to the space. At one point, my co-workers and I tried to go to the shop, and were confused / not aware that is was on the second floor, and the elevators were not working, or something. It's kinda frustrating because we just never made it to the place, and I missed out on this delicious pizza for an entire year after that. But when I finally made it to the place, it reminded me of a college dorm rec room that happened to sell pizza. Random furniture, a large tv playing soccer with foreign commentators, complete with a ping pong table and vending machines. The staff is friendly and service is quick, but not too quick.

My husband agrees, and he's eaten a lot more meat in his life than me, so that says something.But, first things first. We arrived on a Sunday night with no reservation, but got in straight away.  I had some doubts about the place just on principal as usually hotel restaurants are overpriced and underwhelming.  But we were staying at the hotel and too tired and had seen some pretty good yelp reviews, so we figure, why not?The view was nice, augmented by a great firepit on the balcony.  The service was also excellent, everyone was friendly, helpful, and always there when you needed them, never there when you didn't.  Nothing snooty or condescending.  The crowd was mixed, which I'm assuming it usually is in Scottsdale.  Older retired types, daggy looking tourists from out-of-town, rich old guys with young girls with big fake breasts, people on business trips, etc.  I wouldn't call it trendy.For food we ordered a cold lobster appetiser with aioli, which was excellent. We both had filet mignons with about three sauces on the side, as recommended by our waiter.  The steak was amazing, thick and juicy and tender and full of flavor.  The sauces, as my husband pointed out, were really not necessary, but did kick it up to the next flavor level.  We had a side of asparagus to share.  We are not huge eaters, so sharing a starter, ordering a small size steak each, and one side dish was enough.  If you are a bigger eater you might want to order your own starter and one side dish per person, as the steaks come with no sides.  We ended up sharing the apple tarte dessert, which was good.  The apples were a bit too sweet, but the cinnamon ice cream on the side was just spicy enough to balance the overly sweet apples.Given the quality of the food I thought the prices were pretty fair. I""d go back if I lived in the area, of if I come visit again.  Thumbs up!"

The room is beautiful and located across from the giant Fashion Show Mall, all valet hotel, the service was a little slow. I think they were a bit understaffed, with that said, the staff was always friendly. We had an issue with the movie channels and engineering came up and fixed it right away. Housekeeping was also on hand with I was cooking the lasagnas. We did have to call them three times to come up, again, I think that is a staffing issue.Tip: Since this is an all valet hotel call valet prior to going downstairs so that they can bring your car up. Also, strip facing views are amazing... we stayed in Penthouse 6000. It is not a casino so keep that in mind if you plan on booking and I didn't think the restaurant there was that great either.

It's not a run-of-the-mill butcher counter, but that's part of what makes the place special.Then, there's the cooked food.  I enjoyed a Toulouse sausage sandwich with Panetta and a fried egg on top.  My friend enjoyed the Chicken burrito that seemed to have smoked chicken, ham, scrambled egg and cheese.  Both were delicious and well worth the trip."

Very relaxed atmosphere and they let you rock a gong when you buy a bike.

I had their Mediterranean flat bread personal pizza which was absolutely amazing. The crust had just the right amount of crispness and the portion was filling. However I was more taken aback by the restaurant itself. We decided to sit outside on the patio which had a very trendy upscale feel. It had comfortable seating arrangements complete with string lights, a fire pit, and misters for those uncomfortable Arizona nights. I couldn't help but compare the restaurant to Postino's as it offers similar food and ambiance however Timo's definitely comes out on top. Postino's is often cramped with outrageous wait times and I have to say that the venue is a lot nicer here with better food. This place is an awesome restaurant to either bring a group of friends as they have good drink specials with large amounts of group seating or the perfect place to take a date as it's super classy with great food and lighting. Great job Timo's you've definitely impressed me and I will be sure to be back."

The place serves up what I would consider Southwestern and American fusion food.  I came here with a date on a Wednesday night so the place was pretty slow overall.  I didn't care for having the staff hanging at the bar since as a manager of the business; that bothers me much.  I ordered a Whiskey and ginger and proceeded with ordering for the both of us.  The menu was split from small versus large plates.  We shot for the small plates so we can share.  We ordered the Braised Duck Taquitos, Steamed Mussels, and Patty's Fish Tacos.  The mussels were excellent for a chilly night as it was when we attended; warm chipotle-chorizo sauce giving it an extra kick of spice along with some crustini bread.  The fish tacos had a subtle bite and a minor kick of chipotle; crunch from the cabbage, but one thing I notice most was the corn tortilla which tasted homemade.  The duck taquitos was well plated, topped with radish and red onions and surrounded by a tomatillo and pablano sauce -- Oh yeah probably my favorite of the night.  We finished the night with some Mexican Chocolate and brownie to an already great night of eats.  Overall, a great place for a foodie to grab some experimental bites! - Enjoy!"

I bought 4 tickets online by mistake and wanted 3. I showed up to the box office (3 days before the show) told them my mistake and they said no problem and gave me a cash refund (even though it clearly states no refunds on internet orders)great customer service, great STAR CLASS experience, worth the extra $2 (but had free popcorn remember) amazing food for a movie theater. next time I'll try the motion seats :)"

First off, it is located in a ghetto/semi vacant strip mall. Once you get inside the store though, it is a simple looking bakery. There are many kinds of cakes and chocolates but I've been here mainly for the macaroons. I've also had a chance to try the peaches (look like the fruit but are like whoopie pies with some type of butter cream filling) and the cheesecake filled waffle cones. They are really good and I'd recommend them too. But back to the macaroons!The first time I went, I was helped by the owner who is a very enthusiastic man. He even gave us an extra macaroon on the house! The macaroons are stored back in the freezer but he let us know which flavors they had and we picked from there. The second time a female employee helped us out and again let us know which flavors they had. These are small macaroons, which only take about 2-3 bites to finish. I believe they are 1.65 each. Don't let the size fool you though. They are packed full of flavor. So far I've tried coffee, mint, raspberry, caramel, white chocolate, mango, vanilla, pistachio, and dark chocolate. Personal favorites are the raspberry, mango, and mint. Maybe next time I'll get around to trying the eclairs and other cakes they had but for sure the macaroons keep me coming back."

A quarter of the cut was super fatty and the texture was kinda tough compared to other rib eyes I normally have.  Bff Jen had the filet and that cut was what I wished mine tasted like.  The filet was extremely tender, juicy, and flavorful.  For sides we got the everything potatoes and that was decent. The best side they offer was the gnocchi.  This side alone gives them an extra star in my book.  I can eat this as my entrÌ©e and be 100% satisfied.  For dessert, we got the smores; where you can roast your own marshmallows.

The traditional nigiri pieces (tuna, salmon, tomago, hamachi, etc) were all perfect but the one that stood out was the toro.  I have never had such nice pieces of toro before at any sushi place.  The jidori organic chicken, grilled on a skewer under the robatyaki section, was nicely cooked, tender, and well seasoned.Obviously, this meal will not be cheap so if you're looking for a value, do not bother.

There are 3 floors of fabulous things to do for kids of all ages! If you have a young one, the under 3 room on the 3rd floor is perfect. In fact we spend most of our time there. (My daughter is almost 20 months old now). There is an employee standing at the entrance monitoring who comes in and out. Unlike the malls where kids who are clearly too old dominate the play area, these employees make sure the big kids stay out! My daughter loves the pretend grocery store as well, but it can turn bad if there isn't a cart available for her to push around the room. We ended up getting an annual pass & as long as you go a few times it pays for itself. Definitely the most economical way to enjoy the museum. If you can come in to play after 12:30 in the afternoon it tends to be a lot less busy too!"

It really gave us the feeling of being in Japan, or Okinawa. I asked the waitress about the Shamisen player and she told me that the have a live performance every 2nd and 4th friday, 3 times nightly!

When I think of going out for breakfast, I don't think of the chains first (IHOP, Denny's, or Coco's), I think of the little local places, like Omelet House, Jamms, and now this place. This family-owned restaurant is located across the street from our Vet's (DI Animal Hospital) and over the years, I've wondered how good it was, noticed that there were always cars in the parking lot. Saw the menu online, www.menusearch.net (good prices!) when I did a search recently (friday night) and wanted to scope it out for an upcoming event. No, it's not related to the other Omelet House restaurants, but there are some similarities. (1) You can get spuds, and (2) substitute freshly baked pumpkin bread for the bread choice @ 99 cents, you can't go wrong. There are breakfast specials, $4.99 and under, at the top of the menu (these are updated prices, from the menu online). Add 99 cents for weekend prices. Also, (3) like the Omelet House, this restaurant closes at 3 pm. But you can get breakfast for lunch here, if you like (don't remember if you can get breakfast for lunch there). I ordered the country scrambler- ham, onions, mushrooms, & cheddar cheese. The pumpkin bread and butter came first; it was pretty good, but only had one bite so I could eat my meal without being full. The spuds were seasoned lightly and very crispy, golden brown, (""better than theirs"" our server, Veronica said, as we placed our order), and yes, we agreed!- Sometimes the competition's spuds are a little oily and soggy at the bottom. Unlike the competition's large servings (and hence the higher prices), it was just right for me. My husband got the chicken philly sandwich, and I had a bite, it was pretty good, a little ooey gooey (melted cheese on a philly is a good sign), and he finished every bite, too, scooping up the fallen onions and peppers with a fork. Also, my husband helped me finish the bread. Needless to say, was satisfied, and glad that I did my research online friday night. There is a pretty good size menu, lots of yummy selections. I want to try the stuffed french toast next time, or maybe the corned beef hash (my favorite). Lots of items average about $6.00 generally for breakfast, and about $8.00 for lunch. Omelets you can have either Small or Large. Lunch is sandwiches, burgers, chili, soup, salads, and also a kids menu.The atmosphere is totally 1950s, the decor on our side of the wall was Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, & James Dean. On the opposite wall are record covers. While there was oldies music playing, we also heard hits from the 1970s too. Old fashioned floor, black & white blocks. The bathrooms are marked ""His"" and Hers"". There isn't a baby changing station but I used the stool with a couple seat covers on top (hey, mom's have to be creative sometimes). It was a particularly hot day yesterday and there weren't too many patrons for lunch, a few other parties besides us. Clean too. This is a casual place, seat yourself- lots of booths & tables too. Our server was super nice and when the baby toppled over the glass of water all over the table, she wasn't annoyed, she just acted really fast, and got assistance from two others there. No biggie. With tip, the bill for both of us was $20.00.No longer curious, eager to go back again, this is a little gem in the desert. It's one of those little places that could be featured on DDD, but at the same time, don't want the secret ot be out, either."

I had actually researched 2 other tour companies and was trying to figure out which to go with when I was reading through the reviews of my hotel on Trip Advisor and noticed that many people were mentioning Detours.  When I visited their website and saw their video and all of the information they provide - I knew immediately that this was the company I had to go with.  Their vans are comfortable with Captains Chairs rather than bench seating and their 15 passenger vans they only put seating in for 10 plus the driver which gives everyone ample room.  They aren't looking to be the biggest - they just want to be the best - and they are!We did the Grand Canyon the first day (with 2 short stops in Sedona one for a photo opportunity and the next to use the facilities and shop around for about 30 minutes while the driver went to pick up our bagged lunches (which we ordered off the menu on the ride there and were fabulous by the way).If I were not returning the next day on a full day Sedona Tour I might have been disappointed by what little time we had in Sedona - but the ride to the Grand Canyon from Phoenix is a long one so you are limited by the hours of daylight you're going to have.  If you really want to see Sedona you need to do the separate tour for that - or even spend a few days there - which is what I wish I did and will do at some point in the future.  But back to the Grand Canyon Tour - Larry our tour guide had taken over 1600 tour groups to the Canyon in his years as a tour guide.  He was awesome.  His knowledge of all things Arizona was amazing and we got a great lesson in Native American History as well.   We went to 3 different view points at the Grand Canyon - each more spectacular than the one before.  We were able to pull right up and not have to worry about a thing.  Larry got the people who wanted to go on a Helicopter Ride all set up and was able to meet the varied needs of each of us in the van.  On the way home he even played mixed CD's he had made.  A nice touch.  Our Sedona Tour the next day was just as good as the Grand Canyon Tour.  Les  was our tour guide.  He was also very knowledgeable. Played an excellent selection of music that went well with the scenery and gave us a great tour of Sedona and the surrounding Canyons. He even brought along a native american flute that he played at the various stops we made.  Nice touch.  I can't even put into words just how wonderful my experience with Detours was.  You have to experience it yourself.  For I feel I can't even do it justice.

Sean's work installing our floors tied for first place. I cannot recommend him highly enough! If you know a lot about construction, you'll appreciate his attention to detail and his willingness to customize/accommodate any situation. If you don't care much about the details of the work, you might have to tell him that from the get-go, as he's very detail-oriented and can take quite some time in going over things with you. I'd definitely rather have someone who is overly thorough than the alternative, right? For me, a perfectionist, Sean is just the ticket.He and his assistant are very professional and courteous, and also friendly and personable. I had no worries having them in my home. They even helped me roll our 350lb commercial range across the new floors. He moved his truck willingly when I was coming or going. And when our floor contracted (shrunk) more than expected after 6 months of installation, Sean returned to make complimentary adjustments. I highly recommend hiring Sean. I would do it again in a heartbeat.[The only other thing I learned from hiring so many contractors is that I need to ask them all to smoke in their car or in the street. I'm a little sensitive about cigarettes, and most contractors smoke these days, so that's just a tip from me to you (if you're interested). Just say it at the beginning when you hire them and get it over with! No more cigarette butts in your driveway or your landscaping!]"

Just three days ago, I was at another Subway in Henderson ordering a sandwich platter for a meeting and so I have something recent to compare:a.  Meats - I think they are controlled by this, so nothing special.b.  Veggies - They really packed these on. Compared to the Henderson one, they went all out.c.  Service - I was there at 11:15 and one person was before me. When I ordered the platter which is 5 sandwiches,  Then, 5 people came in immediately after me, so they had a very busy time. Immediately two others came out of the back and started helping all the other clients. Excellent way to manage client expectations and a busy load. d.  More - They even asked me if I wanted another sandwich for 5.00 more as it will pack the tray that is reserved for the mustard and mayo packs. I did do this and it rounded out the platter nicely.  At the henderson Store, they did not ask and I did not know and the tray looked a bit empty to me and not a nice way to impress the meeting.6.  Overall - The service here for a chain was tremendous.

I kept eye balling these HUGE onion rings that were passing our table and said I HAD to go back at some point and get my onion rings.  It was a must-do. The next day for lunch we needed something sort of easy and quick. It was Sunday and we walked in around 1130 am to see a JAMMED room of people WAITING for tables to get in....I'm telling you, it's THAT good. We by-passed them and went to the Fireside Lounge side of the facility. We ordered a few cocktails a fruit/cheese plate, BIG bowl of Onion Rings as big as your head...and a plate of sliders. I didn't touch the fruit/cheese, overdosed on Onion Rings as planned and had a slider with maybe a few chips.  The food was again, awesome.  Next time I'm just getting those onion rings. :) We made fun of it yet went there TWICE.  We like our grub and it was worth going two times. Prices are more than fair and the staff is good."

Whether it be a base tan needed before a vaca, maintaining that glow throughout winter... or even during the hot summer months when I just don't have time to lay out for hours.Most salons down here require a monthly membership. Not Camelback Tanning! The packages are all so flexible.. & inexpensive! I personally buy the individual 7 tans.. They never expire and can be used for either a bed or a stand up.. My personal preference is the stand up.Let's not get me started on the tanning lotion.  Same exact lotion I paid 90 bucks for in NY is sold here for 23 bucks !! What a deal!  .. Actually feel a little silly now looking back and paying so much for it.The staff here is amazing and so is the ownership.  . You can truly tell they care about their customers... I've been coming here for years and I've never had a bulb out. I personally drive to Arcadia area just to go tanning here.. I live in south Scottsdale.  Worth the drive for me? - heck ya! .. I'll sacrifice time for quality any day of the week.If you're new to the area or just looking for a place where you can save some $ ... Camelback tanning is my TOP recommendation."

I came here on a business lunch with 5 other people and one in my group is Greek by origin so he took the lead by ordering for us!  For appetizers, we ordered the Elounda special which was so amazing and tasty!  Crispy and lightly seasoned but so great in tasting!  As well with this there was a side of Tzatziki plus a red pepper-cheese spread.  Then some nice lightly fried Calamari.  The Calamari was amazing.... so light and crispy!   Then onto the next a huge chunky greek salad and as well some bread.  By this time I was feeling lightly full and ready to leave.Then came to our table the most appetizing mixed grilled shared plate I've seen in my life!  This was huge jumbo shrimp grilled, the most tender chicken, some grilled lamb, with fries and potatoes.  Then they brought out some vegetables, rice and some more fries!  Take a look at my photo but it doesn't do justice because this was enough food for 6 hungry guys!  If you look at their menu they have one of the most solid seafood selections I would claim in Montreal.  Amazing selection!    Decor of the place is nothing amazing....like an old neighbourhood Greek restaurant but the food is insanely good!  All was very lightly seasoned but so mouth watering and flavourful!"

You can easily sense that he takes pride in meeting members and making this place feel like your second home. Everything is brand new here, as they have only been open for a few months. You can see that they did not spare any expenses since everything you need is in this gym...including a mediation room! They have 2 showers and 2 restrooms, along with plenty of storage space for your bags and a Sparklett water dispenser. They went with top of the line equipment, and everything is pristinely clean. Due to my rotating work schedule, I've been to the: Mesa, Chandler, North Scottsdale, Glendale,  and this location. I have to drive a bit out of my way just to go to this gym, but it's definitely worth it. Finally, a few pros v.s. other locations: barbell rack (missing in Mesa), numerous benches and space for free weights (lacking at Glendale and Chandler), brightly lit and no dead space (Glendale), TVs are actually on (Mesa)."

I have been 3 times, twice for dinner and once for lunch.  Service has been good to very good.  Not having a lot of experience with Thai food, I always have a lot of questions and like to ask for menu explainations. My inquiries have always been met with smiles, good descriptions, and some great suggestions.  I love spicy food, but would not say that anything I have tried is overly spicy.  I have enjoyed most of the small plates and the Miang Kum is a personal favorite.  For lunch, the bento box is a good way to try a smaller taste of several different dishes.  This is a great place to order several things and dine family style with your companions. The dÌ©cor has a cool, urban vibe. Unfortunately, during busy times, it can be a bit noisy.  Upstairs there is another dining area that would be really great for a private party.

Not just neon signage, the museum also houses fiberglass sculptures including a giant skull from the Treasure Island among others.It was a fun and interesting tour and I'd recommend it.

For starters we got the Wagyu Beef Tartare - delicious except for a strange crispy chocolate that came with it that I didn't really care for.We continued with a wonderful Grilled Santa Rosa Plums salad, with wonderful guanciale and pork belly. I did wish that the salad was cut a little more, since it was a bit hard to down. Yukon Gold Potato Gnocchi was on the money! Definitely a good amount of black truffle in there and yummy lamb to boot. This is HEAVY and will fill you up although its appearance may seem small... yummy and rich.Maine Day Boat Scallops, favorite of my server and definitely my favorite of the night. The scallops are huge and bury a beautiful braised oxtail on the bottom. The oxtail melts in your mouth and is truly a treasure. Worth the visit!

This should not be a problem for most since they are only in Vegas. I went back two years later to get my watch cleaned and the service was great. The staff is very educated and knowledgeable.

Markus's salad was the same size but had an array of fruit on it. All of us were shocked of how big the portions were. I ordered my cheeseburger well done.. but it came back a bit burnt.

Come here! The chicken noodle with matzo ball hit the spot! ..and so did the open face roast beef sandwich smothered in brown gravy...and so did the open Reuben sandwich piled soo high with corned beef smothered in sauerkraut and Swiss cheese.  You get the picture.  All the dishes that Mr. B & I  tried here was delicious and I'd say that was the best chicken noodle matzoh ball soup I've tried by far! It was just that fabulous!  Broth flavorful, with sliced carrots and celery that were soft from simmering in the chicken broth,  chunks of tender white chicken meat, the noodles were thin, the matzo ball light and fluffy texture.  The small size was the perfect serving for lunch for me. The open faced sandwiches here are huge portions. Meats, lean and tender and not salty.  Couldn't finish and had plenty leftover.  Ambiance - The sign when you step in will either read ""seat yourself"" or ""wait to be seated."" Comfy booth seating or table and hardwood chairs.  It's not a big dining area and the place looks kind dated, but clean.  Service wise - It's super busy both times we been there, but orders and food came out promptly.  As it got even busier though it was at least 15 minutes till our server could get to us again and ask for the check, then another few minutes to close it out.  Not going to hold it against them though since it was just the 1 server and 1 bus person vs. 34 patrons (yes I had time to count everyone while we waited) Luckily everyone in there was patient and understanding.  Good food does that to ya!! ...oh and props to Vegas J for posting the food porn that led me here!"

At a glance, the menu is american but seems to be inspired by mediterranean, middle eastern, indian, caribbean and latin american flavors.   I love the wings, burgers, steak salad, chicken sandwich.  Cons: they put way too much cheese on everything, the salsa and guacamole is below average.  And the thing I love most about this place is the design.  They took a mid-century modern bank and turned into an ultra sleek modern tavern."

Remote controlled shades and curtains on the windows; separate sitting rooms; deliriously comfortable beds; two sinks in the bathroom; and (best of all) luxuriously deep soaking tubs.The casino is nice, but the shopping and food are nicer.  Lots of great stuff at the Grand Canal shops -- a personal favorite is Basin White, which sells awesome bath products.  Buy a couple of bath bombs there, and take advantage of the soaking tub!  For food, try brunch at Bouchon by the 10th floor pool.  For quicker breakfast to go, try chocolate croissants at the Bouchon Bakery near the hotel elevators.  For dinner, try Canaletto (get the roasted pear ravioli) or Postrio (by Wolfgang Puck -- try the meatloaf)."

How cool is that?That being said, it can be a pretty confusing place inside once you have a few drinks in you, especially if you have never been there before. They keep it pretty dark and for me at least, it got a bit disorientating. Then again, I had been drinking, so who knows how much that came into play. All in all, Lava Lounge was a shining light in an area overrun by bro bars, and if I ever find myself in Pittsburgh again, I will be sure to make a trip to the South Side and visit this Fraggle Rock-esque bar again.

I know this now. I have seen the light.It was a marshmallow... In. A. Cup.The hot chocolate came in a little jug beside it. And as I poured that creamy yum into the cup, the marshmallow began to gooify and disintegrate, becoming one with the liquid, until only part of its mass bobbed around on the surface. And the hot chocolate was rich, and viscose, and sweet, and... revelatory.Now then, it wasn't a big cup, and it did cost me å£3. Likewise, a very slim sliver of lemon drizzle cake, dense and moist though it was, set me back å£2.60.

I want to relate a story that says volumes about the quality of this restaurant. If Red Rocks is not on your list of places to go for just about any occasion, it will be after you read this:Last week I ate there two evenings consecutively. The first night I had Michael as a server and the next night I had Joshua. The spectrum of servers I encounter most places these days runs from disgruntled, overworked, ""I'll fit you in when I can"" to the overly solicitous, ""yes sir, my pleasure sir, remove your crums sir, add another cube to  glass sir"". These two guys blew me away with how enthusiastic they were about Red Rocks, they informed me what chef was preparing in the kitchen (naturally right?) but then went on to talk about the causes the restaurant was involved in, how their lives had been affected, Joshua related what the chef was doing to things he enjoys cooking and trying and his overall love of food, Michael talked about the owner and how he had impacted the lives of numerous employees. When I go out to eat, I go for a break and even if it's business I want it to be pleasant. Well these two guys were just doing their job but afterwards I felt like not only had I had a nice meal but I felt I'd been taken care of and I knew that I had given my business to restaurant that is making a difference in the lives of it's employees, patrons and community. Not a novel thought exactly but certainly there are not many places that execute that so well as Red Rocks. I think those two guys are certainly valued employees but most importantly, I can assure you that Red Rocks is doing something very special for their employees to feel that good about their place of employment and for them to extend that to us, the dining public! Thank you Red Rocks. If you are like me and you think of all these restaurants you could go to and then the moment you actually are getting ready to go,the mind goes blank....put Red Rocks at the very top of your list. You will be very glad you did."

The veggies definitely seem ""cut today"" fresh, and all the rice types I tried were cooked to perfection.  There are some unconventional twists on old favorites as well-- the General Tso's for example, has little caramelized orange peel slices which, while surprising and very strong in flavor, were a pleasant addition.  There are also some non-Chinese options, such as the Raspberry Mango Cheesecake dessert.   From what I was told by my partner, it was stellar, but she didn't give me a chance to taste it!Although prices are almost entirely under $10 per entree, I would happily pay at least 12.00 for a plate of  food of this quality- and the portion sizes are easily share-able, or if you're inclined to leftovers, would make 3 modest sized lunches!The dining room and restroom is clean, tasteful, and pleasantly lighted, so a sit-in lunch or dinner would be very enjoyable,  though delivery and take-out are also great options.

Let's rundown your checklist as we head over to Le's:1.  You, the pious foodie, makes a pilgrimage to a part of town not showcased in the city's tourism materials, where you will be greatly outnumbered by people you never knew inhabited said city speaking a language that you cannot begin to decipher.  CHECK.2.  In search of ethnic cuisine that is either hard to find or lacks authenticity at the more ""main stream"" food establishments.  CHECK.3.  In a place that, upon first encounter, has you thinking, ""There's no way this can be sanitary!""  CHECK.4.  And, after throwing all caution aside, you dig in and find mastery in the most unlikeliest of places.  Nirvana ensues.  CHECK CHECK.That is a trip to Le's and if the above appeals to you at all (along with the Viet-French fusion that is the banh mi sandwich) this is a must for Charlotte adventurers.  No big menus, no table-side service, no inkling this place even exists until you walk thru the rundown bomb-shelter of a mall and stumble upon this bustling corner shop.  Blind trust is finally rewarded.Le's does one thing only and one thing well: the banh mi sandwich.  The freshest of French baguette- crisp on the outside, creamy smooth inside- kept warm till serving time.  The heat of fresh jalapeno and the fresh earthiness of cilantro.  Pickled vegetables layered in between.  Sounding good?   At less than $4.00 a piece, you'll likely find yourself wanting more than one,  but bring your Benjamin's, no plastic accepted here. As Anthony quips, ""What can I say, I happen to be an aficionado of the dive bar.""

For a restaurant that is part of a chain of restaurants, there's really nothing that can compare to Mastros.  There's nothing chain about the experience or the ambiance of Ocean Club.  My last visit here was on a night in the middle of the week.  That didn't stop what seemed to be the rest of Scottsdale from coming here for a great evening of food and libations.  When you walk into Ocean Club, there is an ambiance that simply states sophistication and upscale.  I was fortunate to be on the arm of a dashing and handsome gent as we were joined by another couple.  We were seated promptly for our reservation at a fantastic table that had a great view across the dining room.  The service was impeccable.  We ordered drinks and a bottle of wine suggested by our server.  We ordered a couple of appetizers and we were set for while as we looked over the menu and carried on conversation with our friends.  My friend and I are pretty easy to please at restaurants like this.  Dare I say, we're pretty predictable.... for me almost always I order sea bass if it is on the menu and my friend 100% orders bone-in filet.  We were in luck, they had both on the menu as a great and amazing establishment like this should.  Their sea bass was as buttery and delicious as it was the first time I had it and all the other times thereafter.So, the sides are where we usually get somewhat creative.  I suggest the lobster mashed potatoes, so very yummy and succulent and filling.  Not something I would order, but I definitely enjoy when someone else has ordered it at the table!  The garlic mashed potatoes are also tasty.  My friend loves the creamed corn.  My personal favorite is the sauteed spinach.  For dessert, my friend loves Mastro's butter cake and we never go there without having it.  Again, very tasty and delicious.This is a place to bring your mom for her birthday or parent's wedding anniversary, a woman that you are with that you care for or just care to get with.  This place is fantastic.  It is truly as good as it gets.  I'm also a HUGE fan of Mastro's Steakhouse.  I'm totally biased, this is the best restaurant chain on the planet.  Period."

Lexie was our server and really made the experience great.  The sweet tea was really sweet and great.  Our glasses / jars were never empty the whole time we were there.  We had onion rings as an appetizer and they were crispy and the wife kept eating all the little crunchies.  Lexie brought us out samples of Ì©touffÌ©e and gumbo to try as well as horseradish mustard to go with the onion rings.The daughter really liked the Ì©touffÌ©e.  We ended up with 2 po boys, chicken strips and crispy shrimp.  The po boys were really good, even the son who doesn't like lettuce / tomatoes said the sauce made it, he had the shrimp. I had the tilapia and it was good as well.  The rolls were good but maybe just a little big for a po boy.  The 6 inch filled me up and the son brought the other half of his ""stomach bigger than brain"" 12 inch home.  The wife got the chicken and she liked it but it seemed kinda bland to me.  The daughter liked her shrimp but dipped her first into what she thought was a ketchup container but was like spicy cocktail sauce.  I also had red beans and rice as a side and those were great, I would go back just for those, over dirty rice as Lexie suggested.The place is a little set away from the street, so slightly difficult to find the first time.  There was lots of take out going on the whole time we were there so that tells you it's good.  Not a whole lot of ambience and for some reason the table seemed slightly high.  We were seated closer to the kitchen and I could hear a beeping from my seat the whole time we were there, although the rest of the fam couldn't.  It helps if you like seafood, the wife thinks maybe a salad option would be good as well.  Never having been to Louisiana I can't say how authentic but overall tasted good to all of us!  I read on here afterwards that they can do gluten free for most anything, but didn't see that on the menu, should be a more prominent option there.The service was really a highlight so ask for Lexie when you go, she's  a great steward for the place and knows her stuff.   All her recommendations were right on and I would trust her from now on. I would give 4.5 stars if I could.  We will be back."

I went on a weekday evening about 8:30pm and was surprised how busy it was.  First good sign. The two of us were immediately seated and served chilled water in the most interesting copper goblets.  A selction of chutney and papadum came right away as well.  The Hostess was also our server, She took our beverage order while we began a strategy of what to order.  The menu was very extensive and contained many items I had never heard of before. Despite the wide array of choices we stayed pretty basic, choosing a paneer masala, chicken tikka, a savory chick pea dish and of course basmati rice and naan.  The meal came quickly and was the freshest I think I have ever had.  Every bite was phenomenal.From the Service to the dishes and everything in between made this experience truly memorable.  I cannot wait to go back!!The only thing I would change- Now I am being hyper critical, would be the lighting.  It was very bright for an evening meal.

It's not huge, but they make the most of their space, including short films, longer presentations, and a huge display of kachinas in telling the cultural stories of Southwestern Native Americans. Importantly realizing that Native American cultures are not dead, the museum contains modern artwork and filmed interviews with members of today's Native American tribes. The amount of information given is detailed but not overwhelming, and I would say that the museum represents an excellent introduction to Southwestern Indian culture.One could complain that the Heard Museum doesn't document any of the internal Indian wars or strife, but on the other hand ,considering the racism these groups still come up against, perhaps its for the best that the rest of us just learn about how complex and beautiful these cultures often were and are. A final note should be given to the beautiful museum itself, which may be the only time I'll ever use the world ""beautiful"" to describe any building in Phoenix. It resembles images I've seen of Roman villas and its courtyard is very mellow, with a nice cafe and pools of running water. I would even recommend coming just to chill out with an ice tea in a stunning courtyard. I mean, where else can you find that in this town?"

I thought it must be a joke and we were on TV.  This thing is so big and so much food it should be on Epic Meal Time!  We were barely able to finish it with two people and didn't need any lunch that day either.The size of the dish didn't in any way take away from the quality and flavor or the food.

The menu was small, but thoughtful. The staff was attentive and gracious. The atmosphere was the only reason that I am only giving four out of five stars. Ordering was a little chaotic. It's a walk up counter/ coffee bar. There are people waiting by the cash register for their to go coffee and it feels congested. But that's the only downside of this neat place. When I sat down at the table to wait for my meal I was given a tiny bowl of homemade granola that was a salty and sweet  and the perfect tapas to nibble on before my mushroom Ragu crep was delivered. My crep came out quickly and it was delicious! There was a little serving of beautifully seasoned sea salt on the side of the plate which parred perfectly with the crep. At the end of the meal I was served a dessert tapas of homemade rose scented marshmallows that are toasted at the table by the server and drizzled with dark chocolate. To die for.

It has both normal tables, and cozy, low tables with cushions vaguely reminiscent of a Japanese aesthetic.This place really specializes in high-quality, straight loose tea.  It's a place you would go if you enjoy your tea without milk or sugar.  The menu is large and diverse.  Most importantly, the people here know how to brew tea properly--including both gong fu brewing (small, brief infusions with more leaf) and using multiple infusions western-style (longer brewing times).The tea here is also very good quality--which, alas, is rare here in the U.S., even among specialty tea shops.  The selection is comprehensive.  You can find some esoteric teas that they don't have here if you look online, but you'll find this place carries all of the well-known teas and quite a few less-well-known ones.  In particular, there's even a good selection of oolongs, which can be hard to find in the U.S.We had the Da Hong Pao and it was outstanding--each infusion had a totally different character.I'm not sure why the other reviewer objected to the bells--I thought they were very cute.  There is a little bell on each table and you can ring it when you want service.Very inexpensive to drink tea in, given how knowledgeable the staff is about brewing, and how the high-quality teas are good for making many infusions.  I definitely recommend ordering a pot.I am eagerly awaiting coming back to this place!"

It sounds like some of you have had a really rough time during your visits. I've been here 3 times and must have lucked out because fortunately I never encountered aggressive dogs. If however during my visits I witness this behavior I will gladly walk up to the owner and ask them politely to leave. That is one thing I can't stand is a dumb ass bringing their aggressive dog to a dog park. When their mean dogs act up you can always count on their owners saying outloud, ""he/she never acts like this, I don't know what's got into him/her."" BULLSHIT.  My one complaint about this place is that I did notice crap here and there and you shouldn't see this in this park because there are plenty of trash bins and an abundant supply of clean up bags. BUt you know there will always be those people that ruin it for the rest of us. I think this place rocks though cuz there is a freakin lake for the dogs to swim! And I love how the entire lake area is covered with pebbles so your dogs feet don't get all muddy. I have 2 little pugs and they love to get in the water with all the big dogs and run around. I don't have any kids yet, but I don't see the harm in people bringing their rugrats as long as they keep an eye on them and prevent them from being trampled by the dogs."

Since it was my birthday, the restaurant surprised me with Dom Perignon - very classy indeed.Breakfast: Very awesome breakfast that will fill you up and leave you happy. I ordered the Mandarin breakfast twice and still couldn't get enough! Also had fresh orange juice and Japanese green tea.Brunch: Wow this was epic. I love the sushi, sashimii...and everything about brunch. At $58/person, it is slightly pricey but very much worth the price. I think I had over $100 worth of sushi by myself, not counting the bunch entree...it was so good.And of course, MOzen followed in the path of the MO so service was beyond excellent!

I really loved this place and wanted to give it the 5-star badge-of-awesome, but I can't bring myself to do that at a place where the food doesn't absolutely blow me away. Now, that isn't to say that the food wasn't great, it just wasn't that 5-star level that you have dreams about when you get home. None-the-less, I will be returning. This place uses organic, local, fresh ingredients for all their food. That is a rare find, my friends. The fresh, organic thing was the main reason I really wanted to give it a 5, but the flavors just didn't knock my socks off. I had the Gobble it Up Sandwich, a Chicken Waldorf salad, and Ginseng Soother smoothie. The sandwich, in my opinion, had one big thing going for it; the havarti cheese. I LOVE havarti cheese and not many places carry it. All in all, the food is good, but the only part that really wowed me me was the smoothie. It's labeled as their stress-reducer smoothie, so I thought I would give it a whirl seeing as a could use a little relaxation before heading back to work. I drank most of the smoothie before the food came, and I really did feel less stressed by then, but I'm not sure how much of that was due to the smoothie.That brings us to the ambiance of the bungalow. It's a very quiet, peaceful place. The sitting areas are pulled off the street a little so you aren't right next to all the noise of the passing cars (not that there are many on that street anyway) and it has this cafe setup. No, not that Starbuck's always-on-speed-everyone-wants-to-kill-eachother-could-there-be-more-noise-in-here? cafe, but a cafe ambiance like they should be. It was quiet, free internet access, and very relaxed. Even the employees of the bungalow seemed relaxed and at ease.This brings me to my third and final point, the staff. The staff here are excellent and they really add to the environment. I was greeted immediately by multiple, geniunely happy employees. Not that fake-smile BS happy that you get at most places, but that I-geniunely-enjoy-my-job happy smile that makes everyone feel better. The only other place I've met people who I knew were that genuinely happy while working was Pittsburgh Willy's, but check their page for that info.Anyways, I really love this place and I will be back. Fresh, organic meals at these prices and sizes just don't exist anywhere else that I know of. Plus, this is one of the bets places to just sit, relax, and completely forget about work while on your lunch break. I'll just have to head back soon!"

I honestly have no idea on Afghan culture let alone on their cuisine, so this was a great intro to their stuff. Like I said their food blew me away. I had the table d'hote, which consisted of lentil soup and lamb korma, with the rose water rice pudding. Loved the soup and the korma not so much of the dessert as I dont like rose water flavor in general. The korma was splendid and my husband's sabzi poolao (spinach one) looked and tasted great too. Oh plus you can BYOW here and apparently they have a cave decor on the other side of the resto thats only open during Fri's and Sat's.Anyway I cant guarantee on the authencity of the cuisine itself, but it did give me good positive feel on it.

At first I was a bit hesitant of not being able to choose my own vendors, but Roxi Floral does great work and really listens to the needs of their clients. Angel, the owner and operator of Roxi Floral, was so easy to work with! Angel was able to quote me prices for items I wanted very quickly and take out/add items as needed. I was able to show her inspiration photos for these ceremony altar pieces I really wanted, and she executed them beautifully. We met with her in person for an initial consultation to get a better idea of our options and I think her website really doesn't do her complete justice. Her young daughter, Roxi, showed us a bouquet she made from older flowers, and she too is a wonfderful florist in the making! I found Angel very easy to work with via email. My favorite pieces she did were the ceremony altar pieces, this plantar box she did with gerber daisies and the candle/flower arrangement she did for our sweetheart table. I also asked if they could incorporate these photo frames into our centerpieces. They charged a very reasonable and small fee and incorporated the photos perfectly with the flowers and candles we had planned for the table.

The hole in the ground, the red rocks and the bat-cave have all been around for thousands of years, and will continue to be around for many lifetimes. You can see them anytime and they're not going anywhere.  Now we are all traveling mortals, placed on this earth for a finite time.  You, me, and Chris (the chef at CafÌ© Monarch) are no exception.  Now I wish all of us, including Chris (the waiter at CafÌ© Monarch) a long and prosperous life.  But lets face it; none of us know what our Creator has in store for us, and that includes Chris (the host at CafÌ© Monarch).  Also, we never know when the landlord is going to sell our shop's location to turn it into a Wal-Mart, and this goes for the place leased by Chris (the busboy at CafÌ© Monarch).  Finally, we never know where we're going to be in a few years.  For example, we could fall in love with someone special and move back to New York City and this includes Chris (the dishwasher at CafÌ© Monarch).Let me put it to you another way... If Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel in disappearing ink, wouldn't you rush off to see it?  Some works of art or natural beauty will last forever.  But when food is art it must be experienced (i.e. eaten) hot off the grill and whenever you can get it.  So when the medium of the 'genius-artist' is food, you have to grab every opportunity to experience the masterpiece.  Chris brings a passion to his cooking.  He tells us that cooking became a necessity as a child, but it was also his chosen form of creative outlet.  He has developed an intuitive ability to combine flavors, spices and textures.  He provides beautiful presentations that are layered with tastes... you and your pals will be guessing at the ingredients.  This ""artwork"" is tasty, healthy and generously portioned.  All for about 40 bucks plus a $10 corking fee.  Arizona is lucky to have Chris feeding a few selected diners who are smart enough to make reservations.  Go see (and eat) this man's art."

They called me back in 30 minutes! The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. There were two people in front, a young girl and a young man. The office furniture had seen better days, but everything was clean which is the most important thing in my book.So I went back and the first nurse was nice and took my vitals, I went to another room and another nurse took me to get an X-ray after 5 minutes. The x-ray tech was nice and took his time to explain what he was doing and why he was doing it. After my x-ray, it only took 10 minutes for the practitioner to come in. I was expecting someone kinda grumpy as you sometimes get when you come to places such as this, but nurse Linder rocked! He was super nice, explained my accurate treatments and prescriptions, and I left being able to breathe again!He even made sure I was okay after my treatment and talked to me some more about my condition even though he was very busy.

It was so good and the prosecco was amazing (and only $5). I love Postinos and thier bruschetta boards. I got a sandwich- the nine iron. It was good my only complaint is that the sauce must've been on the bread for a bit. It was very soggy on the bottom. Also, our server was nice and laid back- almost too laid back. My friend had to go back to work and it took him 20 mins to come and get her card so she could leave."

We wound up here for a business dinner without a reservation and were really surprised that this place wasn't packed.  Our entire party was pleased with the quality of food we got.  We started with the tempura ice fish and the beef roll with enoki mushroom.  Both were spectacular (although how can a pile of little fried fish be anything but?).  Everyone ordered their own entree and didn't really share, but for me, the steamed sea bass on tofu was a great follow up to the heavier appetizers.  The sauce sufficiently allowed the sea bass to shine through.  The fish itself was perfectly flaky.  The tofu added more substance to the dish while not making it heavy.  Can't think of any way to improve this one!  The service was also impeccable.  We were never waiting for drinks and the waiter was always right there if we had a question or wanted to order something.  Even though he was very attentive, he didn't hover.  All in all, a great experience and a pleasant surprise.  If you are looking for some authentic Chinese food and don't want to venture off the strip, add Blossom to your list of options.  You won't be disappointed."

I went to Tacos De Juarez for the first time a week ago after a D-backs game.  I ate a pizza at the game, but had to try the food at this place because it looked like a diamond in the rough.  After eating there, I have discovered; it is a diamond.  The food is absolutely amazing! The tacos have shells that are prepared in house, and the salsas are amazing.

There's normally some type of art on the wall here too - it makes for an interesting place to stop for lunch or breakfast and unwind. There's no pretence; OAPs catching up over pots of tea mix with students and yummy mummies and I've seen a few business meetings being held here too.

The salon is always clean, stations are clean, stylists are friendly and have always been receptive to my questions and helpful with choosing a style.  The stylists that I use are experienced and have solid training. I started having my hair cut by Roya several years ago. Went in once when Roya wasn't there and was seen by Debbie Bell.  I've been going back to Debbie ever since. She's great, always talks about a style first, gives great scalp massages during shampoo and I always leave with a fantastic cut. Today I brought my daughter in to have her hair cut. She donated 10 inches to locks of love a few months ago at Dolce Salon. The stylist at Dolce butchered her hair. When I was talking to Joseph, the stylist at Fantastic Sam's, I told him how unhappy I was with the Dolce cut. He evaluated her hair thoroughly and said that there were a lot of technical issues with her cut and found 1 inch cut errors throughout her hair.  Joseph did a great job with my 11 year old daughter. Not only did my daughter receive a great cut, Joseph was friendly and personable to an 11 year old. Nice guy, experienced stylist. I have since learned that Dolce hires apprentice stylist.  I will never return to Dolce for a cut.  Don't let the price and atmosphere of Fantastic Sam's fool you, they are great at what they do.

A million different places to go both inside and out of the building, so you're bound to find some nook that you're happy in..

There are several options for movies/movie times, and for the most part the lines to buy tickets & at the concessions stand move quickly (although there has been a few times when I'm here they've let the concession stands really get backed up before getting additional help). At the end of the day I really don't see where this location stands out compared to other Harkins w/several screens (of course this location DOES the large Cine Capri screen for whatever the ""big"" movie is a that time, so I guess there's that).

A new place you say? Why of COURSE i'm game to try it! Anyhow, he mentioned that it where the estate house used to be, on the third floor. We arrive, and immediately I am impressed with the ambiance of the place. Low lighting, rich woods and luxe upholstery gives it a modern yet classic east coast club feel. I was able to walk around the whole place, which is quite large actually, and was happy to find lots of patio space overlooking the water. They also play old movies on the patio, with the projection on the wall adjacent. Very cool :). The cigar list is extensive and can be overwhelming to a novice. Not to fear, the staff is there to help you, and they all appeared to be well educated on cigars, cuts, wrappers, the whole shebang. They also have private lockers where you can store your cigars at the right temperature and humidity. Access to these personal lockers is only permitted to members.Moving on to the members portion...they have a variety of memberships you can purchase for access to the club. At the moment, guests are permitted with an entrance fee, but they will be moving to exclusivity in the near future. The memberships range from individual to corporate, and start at $100 per month. The membership aspect of the club is something I personally feel can be both good and bad. I understand wanting to cater to a specific population, and create that idea of exclusivity. However, once you implement and enforce the members only aspect, people that arent members wind up being mad about it, and then you have a split audience. I hope that everything goes well for the Napoleon, and I can't wait to come watch movies!"

An hour later (we had a large group of 6+), we were seated on the patio next to the fireplace, and we had a blast munching on the meat and cheese board, another bruschetta board - the apple+fig jam+brie is amazing, and more wine. They had a fantastic Argentinian Malbec. To our delight, there was a bottle + board special going on that night after 8pm ($20 for both), so we left at closing with full tummies, still moderately full wallets, and happy hearts.

Pure Barre took me over that plateau that I stayed at for the past 4 months.  When I first walked in, the place was very cute and clean which I am a stickler on.  The people there were all extremely nice and welcoming.  I signed a waiver and they showed me where to go and what equipment to pull out.  As I waited, the other ""regular"" students came in looking like different variations of Barbie dolls.  I was like,""here we go....""  The instructor came in looking tone and tight.....very inspirational.  We started the warmup which wore my ass completely out.  Honestly, I didn't know if I would make it.  We then did arm toning and ab workout, then we headed to the BARRE!  By that time, I was soaked in my own sweat and thankful I didn't skip my morning shower to come to class. Ha!  Time for booty blasting at the ballet barre!  That was probably the hardest thing I have done in a LONG time. The music was blasting thank God to muffle my grunts and moans while everyone else maintained their composure.  Maybe they are femmebots?I loved the class and will return again one day, but Pure Barre is quite expensive.

And it's about time!I waited with baited breath for this restaurant to open in one of my favorite plazas adorned with Panera, Chipotle, Cupcakery, and Market Grille Cafe, already a great offering of casual dinner spots.  It finally opened and I managed to get in around 1:30PM for lunch, after running a few errands.  The interior is very purple, with fresh flowers, tinted lights, and a closed off kitchen.  Comfortably seating 31 people, it's a somewhat intimate space.  There would three other tables there, two of which were Vietnamese diners.  (Which is always a good sign.)I was greeted with a bit longer of a menu than I expected, (Not Pho Kim Long's length or anything like that, about five pages of offerings.)  I went with the generic route of ordering Spring Rolls and a basic ""everything"" bowl of Pho.The Pho: Very good.  Not salty at all.  Came out lightening quick, and has a good balance of noodles vs. meat.  Spring Rolls: Really good.  Flavorful, crispy yet moist on the inside with a really nice garnish presentation.  The girl who owns it was very friendly and was ready to make a few recommendations for me on what to order.  I went with a very generic choice since i kind of wanted to get a baseline of what the quality was before I ordered the ""house specialties"", not to mention that I wasn't terribly hungry so I didn't want to overload with appetizers and soup and etc.  I am of the opinion that like all businesses, they're somewhat new with the service so it's going to take a bit to get running super smooth, (i.e. my appetizer came out the same time as my Pho, which made me feel a little rushed), but all good things take time.

After our dinner, I have to say that I am very impressed. The staff is very knowledgeable and in general was excellent.We started off with the Escargots, and for the first time having it, they were really good. The combination of the flavors blended well and the escargots were not too rubbery or hard. The only problem with it was that it was really not, and I nearly burned my tongue.I had the Colorado Rack of Lamb and I think I'm willing to say that it was the best rack of lamb I've ever had. The tenderness and juiciness of the lamb was just perfect. It was very difficult for me to resist grabbing the rack with my hand and gnawing on the meat as if I was eating at home. Tucked underneath the rack of lamb was curried risotto w/goat cheese. It was a very interesting combo and loved how there was a slight kick of spiciness as an aftertaste to the risotto.For someone who wants a change of pace to cheap eats or Las Vegas buffets, Andre's is definitely a place to go check out.

When I moved to the DC area I couldn't find any coffee as good as Prestogeorge's. Luckily, you can order online and have it shipped to your house. Every time I order it comes to my door the next day. This is such a plus for me since I always wait until the last minute to order coffee when I'm running low. You can order whole beans or have them ground to your specific coffee pot/french press. My favorite flavor of coffee is coconut cream. My only complaint is that they don't send you a receipt via email or shipping confirmation. But really, who needs an email when it comes the next day with a printed receipt in the box? Please give this place a try if you're looking for the best and freshest coffee around!"

Motta is has some great little desserts, and affordable take-away food (pizza trio combo with rapini salad was great for a night in). The pizza itself isn't actually that good in my opinion, but despite the name, I think a lot of people go there for their other foods. It's a good, affordable place to pop into if you need something to bring to a dinner party but didn't have time to prepare anything. The one thing I found Motta did very poorly was the all you can eat pizza party. We went one night when it wasn't too busy, but they only came around with pizza twice. It was like they'd chosen to ignore us as the waitress disappeared completely, and when we went up to ask what was going on there was just a cold tray of old pizza sitting on the counter. This was our only eat-in experience, so I'm guessing we just went on a bad night. Still, I wouldn't go there on a date night, as the ambiance isn't particularly warm."

This is all fine and good, and generally a good time.  So how do you kick it into overdrive?  You get the creative juices flowing flowing with a participatory event for everyone.Pinot's Palette, a local paint and drink studio, provided just such the opportunity as we all sat down with a plate full of acrylic paint, a blank canvas and an instructor to lead us through the creation of our own versions of ""Charlotte's Starry Night.""  The space was open and had a nice little bar area tucked into the back corner, to keep the alcohol a-coming.  While you could buy a glass of what they had in house, we rocked the beer from Sierra Nevada- a hoopy little IPA, of which we also got to each take a 6-pick home.  Super nice score!  Wine flowed as well, in both the white and red varities.But the indulgence didn't stop there.  True Crafted pizza was parked just outside the front door with one of the most ridiculous food trucks I've ever seen.  An old Ford pickup, converted with a full wood burning pizza oven in the back AND an open grill.  Once these guys started tossing pies, I swear they didn't stop all night.  And it wasn't just your garden variety pizza, I'm talking some true gourmet works of art here:  garlic and clams, breakfast pies with potatoes and egg, four cheese white pies, and some prosciutto craziness, just to name a few. The pies were cooked to perfection too, with a crust that was crunchy on the outside but had a wonderful chewy tooth on the inside bits.  I don't live near their retail location, but I'd make the journey here for some more of that goodness.  Impressive in both presentation and sheer quantity for this large crew.The actual painting event was quite nice as well, though I easily needed another few hours to get my ""masterpiece"" to a point where I felt like it could be done.  The instructor and her aides were both confident and motivational, always willing to help if you missed an instructional help.  Even for non-painters, these guys would make sure you started with the basics and built your piece up from there.  Things got a bit rushed toward the end, but isn't that always the way?!That's just tells me this was so much fun that the time flew by.  I'd easily go back again, even without the pizza and beer.  Thanks to our CM Nikki for putting it together and to all the vendors who really strutted their skills out for the evening.  Nights like this really show just how diverse Charlotte's dining and entertainment options can be."

The littlest one got a big bowl of spaghetti, which made him happy.Two other sons were happy with their salmon, and lobster ravioli, respectively. And I was very happy with my eggplant parmesan.My wife & i both enjoyed our house merlot.The service was quite good from start to finish.

The pizza.  We were a little hesitant about the crust just by looking at it, but one bite in, we were in love.  The crust was flavorful and light and crispy but not too crispy with a hint of sweetness and that glorious wood-stone oven flavor.  You could tell that the marinara sauce was homemade and it tasted like they'd picked the tomatoes fresh from their garden that morning.  The mozzarella  had just enough pull to melt in your mouth instead of getting caught in your throat and the basil was fresh and glorious.  It was seriously the best pizza I've ever had.

Upon arrival, it was painfully obvious that it was date night in Scottsdale.  This is not a problem - I enjoy pretty people just as much as the next guy.  But, when you're treated like cattle prior to a show beginning, it doesn't give a good 1st impression.  The ""lounge"" area is way too small for the size crowd that was there, and rather than being assigned seats, you're given a card (A, K, Q, J, 10 and so forth) and ushered in Southwest Airlines style - we immediately ushered ourselves back out to the parking lot and stood around like a-holes for a half hour until the show was ready to begin.1st tip / suggestion:  the bouncer & doormen at comedy clubs shouldn't be smug, condescending d*ckheads - merely an observation.  The guy taking tickets was very pleasant - and the wait staff was sweet.  The club itself is decent sized, but the chairs / tables are packed in very tight.  Once the show began, this wasn't a big deal at all.  The host / opener was solid, the Jew who followed him was equally solid, and then the owner came on stage.I have no problem with people who choose to drink or do drugs.  I don't even care of you do both while you're working - as long as you're not putting others in danger.  But if you're on stage, in front of hundreds of people, maybe scale it back a bit.  Sometimes comics are funnier when they're drunk - but they're RARELY funnier when they act like they just did a pencil sized line off someone's booty.  His material was mostly solid, but his delivery was spotty - and he rambled - which is a little insulting to an audience who knows that half the reason you're up there is because you manage the joint.  Ben Gleib was excellent.  70% of his act was interacting with audience members - one in particular made my evening especially pleasant.  There was a tattooed lady in the front row who just wouldn't shut up - which can just be comedy gold - and in this case, it was.  I didn't really know much about him - other than he's regularly on Chealsea Lately.  Bravo sir, I would never have guessed elk hunting would get that much traction, but it did.All in all, it was a solid comedy experience & we will likely be back!"

If you've watched the food channel about the best pizza in the country, then you've heard of Di Fara in Brooklyn. If you've been lucky enough to eat their pizza, you know the food channel is right... Now this famed pizza has (like everything else) come to Las Vegas.  When most great ideas migrate to Vegas, they seem to lose a bit of what makes them great... At least that was before Dom Demarcos. The Vegas joint hit it out of the park. They just opened last Thursday and there was an hour and a half wait on Friday. Apparently Dom Demarco Jr. was in for the opening and he said the pizza was perfect. He assured us it was the same ingredients and he was teaching the Vegas staff how to make it the Di Fara way. We had a square pie (used to be called Sicilian back east) with the best pepperoni I've ever had and it was all fantastic. The crust actually has a flavor to it. The plus is the rest of the menu which was equally great. Salads are fresh and tasty, the meatballs are incredible, the eggplant was awesome and I hate eggplant. The bar is  lively. My wife says the decor is warm and comfortable..Give it all an A+. I could eat there every day for a month and not get tired.

I wish more restaurants had that sort of list.I plan on being a regular at The Barrymore. Next up, I'm gonna sit at the bar, have a glass of wine, and try their burger. If the burger is really good, I may have to move into the Royal Resort permanently. Which might not be so bad. It's clear that the Royal Resort wants to be THE coolster boutique hotel in Vegas.

It's a nice place if you're coming to Vegas to unwind a little with the family. But if you're coming with the expections of going crazy, then it's a little inconvenient. The nearest casino is at the MGM, which is a good 10-15 minute walk. I must be lazy because after making the walk a few times, I was super tired. And forget about walking the strip, I thought that I was going to die on our way back. Taxi! Great place to chill = Signature, wanna go crazy = somewhere else."

We waited for a while before being offered the menu and she wasn't really familiar with the food.  Ok, can't blame her, she's there to get people drunk...  to make a dinner for 2 out of tiny tapas, we ordered 8 items, and all of them delish.I assume you have to go early because when we were about to leave (10:30p) the staff put down a ""reserved"" sign on our table."

We scheduled a trip to Las Vegas to look at all the different photography galleries. Our last stop was The Stratosphere Casino -- Knopf Gallery. Let me just start off by saying --- WOW! From the moment you step in the gallery you feel the Las Vegas Casino atmosphere slip away. The ambience of classical music and the amazing artwork is just the right setting. It's not like some of the other galleries where it's dark and feels like you've entered a cave in the Amazon. This feels like a real art gallery. They even had a grand piano playing music!We ended up spending over 2 hours talking to one of the art consultants Megan. She was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. She was not the least bit pushy. We noticed a few things that while going to other galleries. Most of the sales people would trash talk all the other artists in town. We came here twice and both times different sales people. They couldn't have enough nice things to say about all the other galleries and artists. In fact they even recommended a few other galleries to visit. The one thing that impressed us the most though was the art! It just absolutely breathtaking and natural. We settled on 11 images from John's collection. We didn't even need to go back to the other galleries we had visited. This is one of the best well run businesses I have dealt with. The communication is impeccable. And what I mean by ""impeccable"" is anytime I had a question it was answered in less than a few hours. They spent the time and worked with us on getting a great deal. John (the photographer) even called us in the end to thank us for our time. A real bonus if you ask me!John is a master of his craft and a very talented artist. If you are in the market for interior decorating this is a must place to see! Give the gallery a call and schedule a viewing it is absolutely worth it!"

Probably because nobody knows it exists. I didn't know myself. I could barely even find the place.What a cool divey bar/restaurant. I along with my coworkers all ordered burgers and they didn't disappoint. While not the best burger I've ever had it was moist and delicious. Apparently the burgers are saturated in Burgundy while on the grill which gives them their flavor.Fries do not come with, which is always annoying, but we ordered a mix basket with onion rings and fries and it was quite tasty. Only down note; halfway through the meal my coworker claimed he found a long hair in his burger that he swore up and down wasn't his. Being a self-proclaimed ""goat"", he ate the burger anyway. I know this would warrant an immediate look of disgust and a one star rating by some....but shit happens. Hair gets in burgers. I'll give the place the benefit of the doubt.

As always the food was terrific.  We especially like the new summer menu items.  The curry soup is terrific and very filling.  Last night I had the salad with quinoa and cilantro hummus, my daughter had the turkey burger and my husband had a dish with shrimp, rice and mango (sorry that I can't remember the menu names).  Everything was great. My husband and daughter split the chocolate baklava with vanilla ice cream dessert.  They said it was very yummy. Pita Jungle's menu has a great variety with something appealing for everyone in your group.I really must give high praise to our waiter Joshua Berk.  He is the most attentive, knowledgeable waiter in the restaurant.  (I am not a relative.)  As mentioned, we have eaten at PJ many times often with friends and he has always been a terrific waiter.  He can rattle off the ingredients in any of the specials or other menu items and offers combos/substitutions without missing a beat or reading from a list.  I thought he must be a manager because he is so adept at his job.  (Again, our party did not include one relative or friend of his).  It's just good to acknowledge one someone does a great job, because people mostly give negative feedback or in the case of the restaurant industry, people just stop showing up.  While I noted that the restaurant is loud, the noise level is just fine on the patio, which I recommend when the misters are working or it is not July or August in Phoenix."

Good lord, the duck salad does not look very appetizing when it first comes out, but oh my it was good.  It almost looks like the duck is on a bed of dry grass (looks strange), but do not worry, for a party is about to start in your mouth!!  Clean pieces of crispy duck accompanied with those greens (not really sure what kind they were) with fruit like pomegranate.  The salad was lightly dressed, didn't need help with much of a heavy dressing.  Simple, clean flavors, wow!The rib eye, I have never had rib eye this tender in my whole life.

I couldn't even water the lawn without having dozens of roaches climbing the walls. Before the outdoor problem became an indoor problem I started to search around for a pest control company. This led me to these guys. They did an awesome job and were very thorough. I can now enjoy my yard without having to worry about anything crawling on me. They have definitely earned a   loyal customer and I would gladly recommend them to anyone else!

As a Vegas local I like to treat myself to a meal here several times a year. It's super expensive (over $100 for 2) so make sure you are super hungry before you get here. I have noticed a decline in the offerings over the years: no more freshly carved ribeye, no more crab claws, no more delicate Italian pasta dishes, and green vegetables have been phased out with more cheap carby sides like corn and potatoes -- but it's still a great buffet with great quality food. The dessert station is a thing of beauty. You can try mochi, homemade ice cream, crepes, chocolate dipped strawberries, cheesecake pops and more. Oh nom nom nom. This is THE place I go when I want to blow my low carb eating plan. On my most recent visit I ate 3 baskets of the sweet potato tater tots all by myself.Be prepared to wait in a long line. Try to go at ""off"" times if you don't want to stand around forever. And Pepsi fans rejoice: no Coke products served here!"

A bright, fresh, seasonally and locally-inspired menu with lots of options - anything from snacks in the bar to a menu offering a la carte items, 3 course, 4 course, and 5 course tastings in the beautifully minimalist/rustic/modern dining room that is cozy and inviting.  I dined with a party of six.  We started off in the bar and then moved into the dining area and all did the four-course tasting menu, which allows you to choose any four items from the entire menu (even if you choose to do all cheese, crudo, main or pasta courses).  Our party tried the albacore, ahi, and yellowtail crudo plates and they were all delicious, each quite unique, but equally amazing.  For the cheese course, most of us had the burratta, but one also sampled the fresh mozzarella.  Again, fantastic.  For the pasta, I had the gnocchi,  and others had the squid ink risotto (which was out of this world), and  the dumplings which had pork belly and butternut squash.  For the mains, half got the short ribs and the other half ended up with the pork belly.  We shared a seasonal fruit tart at the end.  Every dish was truly delicious and we left full and very satisfied, unlike some tasting menus.  Really beautiful inside, so friendly and inviting, and really one of the best restaurants in Phoenix.  A real gem and I'm glad we found it!  Can't wait to go back!"

The wait can be long at times so we only come at odd times now.. I know people tend to hate on chain restaurants but I think CF is one of the better ones.. Their portions are huge and the food is tasty. Must Haves:-Chicken Madeira: Everyone's favorite. Its just 2 chicken breasts with madeira sauce, cheese, mushrooms, asparagus and mashed potatoes.. If I'm trying to watch what I eat I substitute the mashed potatoes for broccoli.. -Cajun Jambalaya Pasta: It is not too overly spicy and has just the right amount of kick.-Chicken Lettuce Wraps: If I want something healthy-ish that's not a salad I get this dish.. It's huge so it will fill you up.. They even have noodles as one of the toppings.-Carlton Salad: It's tasty and fresh but the dressing has a very strong sesame oil taste so you may want to ask for the dressing on the side or another dressing.-Bread: Love their bread.. Especially the sweet brown one mmmmm haha-Strawberry lemonade: Sugar rimmed glass.. perfect for a hot Vegas day Service is always friendly and it's a fun place to people watch after or before you shop at Forums~ HOT TIP: If you decide to get a salad you can swap out lettuce for mixed field greens free of charge.. yummmm ;]]]"

Everything ran so smoothly, I couldn't have asked for anything more.

However, the address number is above the door. We stepped in, and we were immediately in a bar. The bar was packed with patrons along the left side. There were about three small tables along the right wall. There is NO place to stand and wait. It was rather uncomfortable for a moment while someone noticed us. There is a small, very dark dining room to the right as you first walk in. We were informed to sit wherever we like. This room had one very large table (room for 10 I believe), and two 4 tops. They had extra chairs, so they may be able to squeeze in more. NO high chairs. They do not split the dish, but they will bring out an extra plate to allow you to split it yourself. We split the tenderloin benedict. Omg. This was a dish with two 3 oz filet mignon, eggs, hollandaise, and a side of pinto beans and potatoes. The tenderloins were so amazing, we could cut them with a butter knife. The beans were so flavorful, I did not realize pinto beans could taste so good. The service was incredible.

Places like Macayos and Garcias may be good but they try to slop so much chile and baja sauce on everything that it really loses out on the real flavor.   However, Delosantos is delicious.I always get the Via Chalupas which is some sort of marinated beef (carne asada) soft tacos.  They are massive and comes with 3 per order with rice and beans.  They are mouthwatering.  I never have to add salsa or sour cream to them and have never been disappointed with those.Most of my family loves to get some form of the tacos, enchiladas, and tostadas.  Just depends on what they want mroe of that night I guess.  And the cheese crisps may be simple but they are cooked great everytime.I don't drink however others in my family will dine on pitchers of margaritas there and they absolutely love them.  I myself hate tequila so no thanks but to each their own. The chips and salsa are staples but the hotter of the 2 salsas has the best flavor in my opinion.  The regular has too much cilantro in it for my liking and I could do without it.  I had tried the chimichanga initially going there and it ws good but nothing too special.  But overall this place has solid mexican food, a friendly staff, and although it might be small and you may have a few minutes to wait, it is well worth it.  I'm giving it 3.5 stars because I haven't tried the entire menu and I am very particular when it comes to Mexican food.  But from what I have tried, well done!"

All the employees in the store were very nice. Will be the only place I buy guns from now on."

I came in with the thought that I wanted rainbow ombrÌ© nails, for the fact that I can never choose one color, I love them all! We came up with idea to do rainbow ombrÌ© glitter nails with the ombrÌ© going vertical since 2 months ago we did ombrÌ© rainbow horizontal. I always wait about 4 weeks in between my fills because the quality of the product they use is great and lasts that long without lifting. I added a couple cute purple bows to accent my nails!

This was our first time staying here so we were excited to see how the rooms looked. We initially thought we booked a room with a balcony and little kitchenette but found out that they did not have this room available when we checked in due to us booking through my wife's conference room block. This wasn't a deal breaker but it would've been nice to see it. We did luckily end up getting the view of the bellagio water show. This was a plus as we got to watch the water show from our room everyday. The room was nicely decorated. The bathroom shower had a window to the room. There was a curtain that you could pull down to put some privacy as well. It was weird that there wasn't a clock in our room or a radio. Not sure if it was just missing or what. We just had to use our phones to see what time it was.The casino is decent. The table games get kinda pricey especially at night and on the weekends. I like playing low limit tables but +$25 gets too pricey for me. They had a lot different games to play. Not a bad layout.The restaurants are on the second floor as well as the wicked spoon buffet and a few shops. They have a nice chandelier bar at the front of the casino next to Las Vegas blvd. It was really nice staying here as it was walking distance away from a lot of places. All in all, I would probably like to stay here again. If you stay here, make sure to try to get the view of the bellagio water show!"

I'm really not a fan of Vegas and went recently because of my family.  I agreed to go only if we stayed at a nice hotel and one that had a kitchen.  I have a toddler so staying at a hotel that has at least a partial kitchen is very important.  Everything about this hotel is fantastic.  We stayed in a one-bedroom suite and it was perfect for us (4 adults and 1 child).  The suite was spacious with many features: 2 full baths, nice & modern decor, high-end appliances, balcony with a nice view, and most importantly, the room was clean.  The customer service was all-around excellent, and starts at the private gated entrance.  The Signature allows you to enjoy Vegas without having to put up with all that is typical of Vegas, e.g., stench of cigarette smoke, loud noise of slot machines, long check-in lines, over-crowded & chaotic valets.  When you want to gamble you can just walk over to the MGM Grand or drive to another hotel.  When you want some peace and quiet you can return to the Signature and enjoy your suite.  I've become so spoiled by the Signature that I can't see myself staying anywhere else when in Vegas, even if it were free!"

I got a great deal through Groupon and I have to say that we enjoyed our stay at this hotel.  With this being said, here are the pluses;*****very nice rooms with, oh so comfortable beds and pillows!  *****Friendly, helpful and courteous staff!*****Large pool area*****Nice size casino*****Beautiful hotel all around*****lots of dining options*****convenient access to all areas of the hotel (given the fact that most Vegas hotels are like mazes to navigate)*****As a guest of the hotel you can use the spa facilities free of charge after having paid the ""resort fee"".*****KID FRIENDLY!  This is a big one.  There are so many things for kids to do here.  There's the bowling alley, arcade, movies, the pool and Kids Quest.  Kids Quest is the child care facility.  At first, my husband and I were skeptical about leaving our two boys there, but went to see what it was about, and left them for a little while (about 30 minutes).  All I have to say is that our sons kept trying to get rid of US, after that time so that they could go back!  I would include to this highlight the fact that the hotel is off the strip, which is great if you're not into the large crowds or if you're traveling with children.There are some drawbacks (that could be minor depending upon your views) that I believe people need to know of;****Pool is NOT HEATED!  it wasn't that big of a deal for us, because we live in LA, so we were there for three days during Spring Break in April, which can be a bit on the cold side.  But, I would love to know this if I were spending thousands of dollars traveling from across the country only to find that I cannot enjoy the pool.  While we were there, it was unfortunate to see that the large and beautiful pool was largely unused because it was ICE COLD!  so, the children were mostly in the hot tubs.  Hence, the adults could not enjoy them. (tip--You can always drop kids off at Kids Quest for a bit, and make your way to the lovely spa to enjoy the generously sized hot tub there)*****Daily resort fee (but most of the resorts in Vegas are doing this as well, so...).  *****Buffet line can get pretty long.  Overall, I know we will be back to this resort.  Especially when traveling with our boys.  I highly recommend it."

Seriously.  It's a little more expensive than Ranch Market, Food City, Sunflower, or Sprouts, but on an item-by-item comparison, you can definitely very easily save over Basha's, Fry's, or Safeway, and you can DEFINITELY DEFINITELY save over ""fresh"" produce options like Whole Foods, AJ's or Trader Joe's.  Like any other shopping experience, you just have to be savvy and cognizant.There is one word why this market is awesome, and should be the envy of every other city in the winter months.  It starts with ""p"" and rhymes with ""vulture.""  Out of guesses?  PERMACULTURE!Phoenix, far from being the completely unforgiving desert most imagine it to be, has been an agricultural valley for centuries, largely because the weather and lack of harsh frosts allow for nutritional plants to be grown  year-round.Try finding fresh produce at a farmer's market in Chicago in December!  Or better yet, don't.  I've tried, and it sucks.The prices of produce vary here on natural factors:  when a crop is near the end of it's growing season, price will go up, as less product will be available.  In the spring, you can get beautiful chard for $1.50 a bunch - I don't know if you can beat that price anywhere - and other fresh greens for about less than you pay for ""organic"" crap in grocery stores.Depending on the vendor and the conventionality/ease of growth of the veggie, you can definitely feed yourself here with modest to zero increase in your produce budget.  For example, carrots, potatoes, onions, and garlic are super duper cheap - and shallots even come in at way less than they do in the usual grocery store.  But if you want heirloom tomatoes, eggs, milk, or cheese, yeah, you're going to have to shell out a little more - but not to an outrageous extent.As for atmosphere, if you want the whole farmer's market experience, definitely drop in on Saturday morning, when families and dogs are out in full force.  There will be a wider variety of vendors, live music, and a general lazy Saturday party feel . Wednesday nights are great, too, though, if you are one of the awesome people who lives in downtown Phoenix and you want to make it to the weekend with fresh veggies.Also, there are tons of cool vendors who sell homemade crafts for affordable prices.  I've gotten many gifts here for my mom, lady friend, and assorted others.Also, they accept food stamps, which is awesome.Bottom line:  if you think adding another two or three bucks to your grocery bill in order to support local, sustainable and delicious produce is going to break your bank, that's understandable.  But don't complain about the prices here unless you are on the verge of bankruptcy.  ::Insert longer rant about how American liberals like to talk about sustainability and the environment but balk at even tiny increases in product expenses::"

I received an email that my apt was cancelled. I called up, really irritated, and the girl I spoke with didn't know what happened but that they still had my appt on file. When I got there, I asked if they anted to see the email I received. The girl said no, that's okay. As I was checked in, they asked for all of my information again. I asked why they didn't already have it when I registered online? She said that their system crashed earlier and lost the information. That's why I received that email earlier. It was just really weird that she didn't mention that up front and before she asked me for all of my information again. Anyway, my deal included the blowout and deep conditioning. I thought the girl did a fantastic job on my hair. It is 2 days later and my hair looks really great still. What makes this place different from Drybar is that they sell boutique clothes and accessories. I think this is a really great addition to the north Scottsdale blowdry game."

And here is where Tapino simply excelled (well, in addition to the food, and the service, and the atmosphere).Each time I've been here, I've conveniently made it in time for happy hour... mmmm... so much deliciousness can be gotten for either $5 a plate, or $5 a glass.  The alcohol and food listed on their happy hour menu, though not extensive, definitely offers something for every taste.  I can have a sweeter Scheurebe while others may enjoy a nice Sauvignon Blanc (yech).  For the non-wine drinker, there's generally 5 drinks (martinis, mojitos, etc).  For the non-alcohol drinker, um... I don't know what to say to you... I'm sorry?The food... ah... the food.  It's delicious, what can I say.  Admittedly, there have been a few items I have only mildly liked, but it was more buyer and user error.  If I *know* I don't like a particular flavour, I probably shouldn't deliberately order something with it.  Sigh.  But there are a few items that just tip the scale so much in Tapino's favor: the beef carpacio is absolutely delicious, the asparagus with the yellow sausce streaked around the edges is Yummy with a capital ""Y"".  But reading the other reviews, not only here but elsewhere, a growing discontent is swelling up inside of me... why don't owners ever come and say ""hi"" to me?

Costumes were really good and the engineering behind the stage and suspension equipment is one of a kind. A must see show. I advise that if selecting seats in the 200 level and above may be better. We were in section 102, row C and too close to the stage. Our seats allowed us close up views of the performers but there is just too much going on in the performance to be too close.

I think Yogurtland is where I want to go when I die. It is like heaven to me. This location just opened, but I have been here twice in the past week already. I hate that they do not have royalty cards. I could really cash in on all my visits if they did! That is the only bad thing about it. This place was full on a Sunday evening and I'm so happy they are open late, until (at least) 11 PM everyday. The taro flavored frozen yogurt never disappoints. Their pistachio and toasted coconut mixed together is also very delicious. Their liquid toppings consists of only about 5 flavors. They do not have Fruity Pebbles, but their crushed graham crackers are a decent substitute. Unlike other places --- the frozen yogurt is great all on its own. You actually do not need toppings, but I would deem you clinically insane if you didn't try any. Go here NOW and don't forget to pick me before you do."

So we made it a mission to try it out. We made reservation 1 month ahead of time to fit in a party of 7. When we arrived 15 minutes before our reservation, we were given the option to wait in the lounge area where we can order drinks and wait for our table. Their HK Antioxidant is most refreshing! Tastes like blueberry lemonade! A must try!Once seated and ready to order, our waiter brings out a display with all the different types of beef/steak on the menu - except for the fact it was raw. This almost deterred me from getting anything beef or steak alike, but in the end I still went with the Marcho Farms Veal Chop.While the Veal Chop was delicious, I must rave about their dessert - Sticky Toffee Pudding. Their Sticky Toffee Pudding is simply - amazing! The combination of the warm and sweet pudding cake doused in brown sugar toffee syrup is quite extraordinary!Only negative point was that towards the end of the night our waiter was gone and it seems as if none of the other waiter knew we existed for a while.

Bread was slightly over toasted but still delicious as we were very hungry. Appetizer was tomato salad w/ feta and delicious.  Entree was the ""lavrika"", whole bass, bone in. Was not a huge fan of the bone in but it was fresh and tasty nonetheless, however my peers were not happy about this whatsoever. Dessert was greek yogurt, mediocre to say the least.

You'll find (seemingly) delicious, all natural and adorable dog treats - both healthy and fresh for your little nugget. Every year on Riley's birthday I saunter over here and grab one peanut butter cupcake with cream cheese frosting. No joke, my dog DIVES into that treat. For $3, it's an awesome, healthy and hilarious way for my pup to celebrate his birthday. There are also a myriad of toys (a bit overpriced, in my opinion), bagged treats (again, made here) and some of the nicest employees in Charlotte. While I don't bring Riley in the store (not dog friendly - don't want to get tossed out of the neighborhood) I spied lots of yappy hours and friendly peeps.

Jellybeans (against the back wall- my brother-in-law's favorite BTW) are priced at $3.25 for 1/4 pound and $12.99 for a full pound.  Candy themed tees were on sale at $11 or $7. Large Hershey Kiss pillows (silver- original) and Huge Hershey Syrup (coin banks?) were the biggest cute candy-themed items here. I even spotted a Hello Kitty section (for all the asian girls out there, myself included, thank you very much). The novelties included the cute list pads (hey, they could come in handy for the list-maker, yup I'm there), pez dispensers (hello kitty & my melody), metal lunch boxes, wonka candies, candy bras (something you usually see in an adult book store, huh?), bug candy (lollipops with scorpians- gross!), bacon shaped candy (saw that on one of the cable channels recently- supposed to be the rage right now).I saw three people working there, one at the cashier counter, another one restocking, and another one on the way out the door (shift ended maybe?). It's bright (white interior mostly), fun (it's candy, c'mon now), and generally clean inside. Nice set-up inside. It didn't feel cramped even with several other customers besides us. There are two flat-screen tvs and the music sounds good (nice marketing huh?). We didn't buy anything, because we had just eaten at Texas De Brazil (mmm, good eats folks) last night and after some walking around Town Square, had some frozen yogurt at Yogurtland (taro & coconut are the best BTW). Oh yeah, a final note- the location- next to the Rave Theater- is a good one, too. Tip: get your candy here before you head into the theater."

Never wanting to spend that much for my car it went untreated for years.  So when I finally decided enough is enough I started looking for places to have my car get a once over.  I came across Kinkade's auto shop and stopped my search. TJ took the time to listen to what I thought was wrong and also explained that they provided a free diagnostic without having to agree to repairs if I didn't want any.  A very nice no pressure approach that was very refreshing.  I decided to take my car in on my lunch break. And was pleasantly surprised that they offered a free shuttle service.  Before the end of the day TJ was able to call and tell me what needed done now, what was recommended soon and what could be put off for some time.  I had originally planned on taking my car for a second opinion but after discussing it with TJ I realized this was the shop to use.  By the end of the next day, my engine mounts were fixed, my oil changed, new brakes and so much more, it's was like I had a new car again.  Once the car was finished they picked me up at my house and took me to my car. Throughout the whole process everyone I encountered was extremely professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. TJ even took the time to recommend some awesome places to visit downtown since I recently moved to the area.  This is definitely an auto shop that cares about the customers and doing the job right.

That was, without question, the best chicken sandwich I have ever eaten in my life, and probably a tie for the best burger.  Options is the name of the game at this place, and there are plenty.  A practically endless array of combinations of unique toppings to put on your burger (battered and fried bacon, anyone?).  My sandwich was fairly standard as far as the toppings went (bacon, poblano mayo, guacamole), but cooked to perfection.My wife's burger, which she claims is the best she's ever had, was a beef burger (cooked medium, yay for grinding your own meat) with brie, bacon, and garlic mayo.  There were countless cheeses and toppings to choose from, and we finished the meal off with some exquisite banana pudding.

At first glance, it is quiet, discrete, and no frills. Yet when you dig deeper and get to know its personality you find something so much more. I am a firm believer that every establishment has room for improvement. However, when I think about it long and hard Secret Pizza really epitomizes all I would want or come to expect of a pizza establishment. I almost dare say that it was the best pizza I have ever had. Nestled in the Cosmopolitan, you would think it would be flashy and glitzy. Rather, it defies that convention and it sits in a nondescript hallway that you would easily bypass. Not that I am saying you should go down every service hallway at the Cosmopolitan, I'm just saying taking the Star Trek like elevator to the third floor above the Chandelier Bar and walk down the nondescript hallway till you find Secret Pizza. Note, the hallway has photos on it to give you some direction.Once there, you will be greeted by the beautiful smell of pizza. While slices are available in the showcase, full pizza's are available as well. I'd probably call ahead if that is the case just to avoid having to wait. Since we didn't know any better, we settled on a simple pepperoni pizza. However as we waited to order, the guy working the counter clearly could tell we wanted a white pizza as well and mentioned that we could have a half pepperoni/half white pizza and it came out to be one of the best decisions we made in Vegas. The pepperoni was really good, but the white pizza was much better. Both offered really great flavors that melded in a perfect harmony that would make angels sing. The pepperoni has just the right amount of salt and spice to counteract the fat and sweetness of the mozzarella. While at the same time the white pizza was an amazingly good blend of ricotta and mozzarella cheese. Both on a thin crust that was easy to work with, yet not being very greasy at all. Service was good with the staff clearly not only knowing their menu but also clearly having skill when it comes to making their pies. They keep the line moving at a carefully timed rate as if it were a well-made machine.Definitely a great place to grab a bite, while they may not have seating grab a glass of wine or beer with the pie and head on out to the main areas. It is definitely one bite you do not want to miss."

My first time was in 1999 and have been to 5 races there. I've been to tracks bigger and smaller than PIR but this track offers the best of everything a race fan could want. Good weather, you can see the whole track from your seat, off track activities and local sheriffs always do a great job moving traffic.

I had driven by this place many times and wanted to check it out in hopes of finding a little family owned Italian restaurant.We could've gone to a multitude of other places that would've been ""new"" to us both, but I'm so glad we stopped in here. Although, it has been described as a place where you might get dressed up to go to, I found it to be very cozy and casual. It's a converted house with a comfy feeling inside from the color tones to the actual curtains on the windows. We felt right at home.Looking over the wine list and hearing the specials from the server, we decided on a Malbec because we, well, we both flippin' love Malbecs. Plus, it seemed it would compliment our dishes. My girl got the chicken piccata, which she very much enjoyed, while I got the chicken paillard. Usually, my test for any Italian restaurant is their lasagna but I was in the mood for something different and they totally hit a home run with what I ordered. The thinly pounded chicken breasts tossed about with olive oil, pesto, sun dried tomatoes, olives and capers was beyond flavorful. Everything complimented each other so well, and then....my girlfriend drizzled some of her white wine/lemon/butter sauce onto my plate and JESUS CHRIST!!! it was so insane!! So we just sorta combined our two dishes and proceeded to mow through our meals, barely making sure we saved enough room for dessert.We easily could've ordered 3 or 4 of the dessert offerings without the slightest argument from each other but prudently, we settled on one to share, the cannoloni. Not too much to say about this. It was good, except for the almond slivers on one end of it. Oddly enough, they tasted a bit fishy. Whatever, all in all it was still a nice way to finish our meal and the rest of our wine.So before I wrap this up, I have to mention the one thing that impressed me the most, the reason for the 5th star. Right in the center of the dining area, they had merged a couple tables together for a larger group of 6 or so. When all their meals were ready, the server brought out the plates except for one. A gentleman at the head of the table ordered the dover sole and that particular dish was brought out by the chef. Right beside the table, the chef meticulously took the fish apart, delicately removed all the bones in one piece, reassembled the meal and then served it up. This, my friends, may be a common occurence for some of you but I had never seen it and I thought it was a very classy touch.I've already told a handful of friends and coworkers about La Fontanella and the fact that I can't wait to return so I can sample some of their other dishes and especially the other desserts.

My sister ordered a bean and cheese empanada, she's a veggie too, and TWICE empanadas came out with meat in them. The employees were very apologetic and we could tell it wasn't purposefully, as if a prep cook had accidentally mixed them up, but could have been bad if my sister had actually taken a bite. But as I said, they were nice about it, and I wouldn't hold it against them. We also ordered three.... Yes three.... Dessert empanadas! Guava and cheese is where it's at.

Thankfully, we were off this past week and were able to finally go on a Friday evening.  We showed up at 5 and we were pretty much the only ones there for a while.Big positives for having the baseball game on in the bar & for our waiter being pretty awesome.  I had seen in a tweet that they had a BBQ pork sandwich that I just had to try and it was really the only thing on my mind.  All of the nonsense about sharing and tapas was completely lost on me.We did order what amounted to fried cheese sticks.  They were okay.  They were made with fontina cheese and the sticks were pretty good but the sauces just didn't do it for me.  One of them was even pear-flavored.  Ugh.The wife also wanted to try the mac & cheese with ""lobstah"" so we got an order of that.  It was pretty good but was served too hot.  I know that sounds weird, but the cheese was all runny when we got it.  It wasn't until we were about finished that it turned into a creamy mac & cheese.  Too bad.All of those complaints aside, I really didn't go for that stuff.  I went for the bbq.  Considering I had tried about 3 different bbq porks over the previous three days, I was beginning to consider myself an expert on the stuff.  The Tuck Shop bbq was wicked good.  It came with sweet potato fries that rivaled Fez (they were even cinnamon-sugary too).  The sauce was a bit spicy and really wasn't needed considering how juicy the pork was.  Really, it was great.  It was a special though, so don't show up looking for it on the menu.Finally, we finished out our meal with a German chocolate cheesecake.  I'm not sure why I ordered this; I hate German chocolate and I can't eat cheesecake...but I ate some of it anyways.  It was so good.  Really one of the better desserts I've had.  To top this all off, I had ordered some lemonade which was actually really good.  I guess they make the syrups there in-house and, while not a traditional lemonade, it was pretty damn good and had free refills.  No complaints there.  Next time, I'm getting the ginger ale."

The atmosphere is fairly LA hipster and it had a gorgeous patio to enjoy the lovely desert weather.I ventured to order the burger with moderate expectations.  I mean I come from the land of Umami and the Oinkster- how could Phoenix have anything on that!?!  Well their bacon cheeseburger definitely made me a believer.  The sauce was excellent and more importantly the burger was cooked to perfection.  To think ordering medium and actually getting a nice slightly bloody burger? Who would have thought.  My companion ordered the ribs and loved them.The best part of this spot you ask?  A fairly well developed whiskey/scotch/bourbon list.

We ordered the queso fundido as an appetizer and it was life-changing! Sooo rich and tasty, I would've ordered this is a meal by itself. YOU MUST ORDER THIS! For my meal, I ordered the huevos rancheros, which was a light and tasty dish made with black beans instead of pinto beans... yum! With my meal I had a mango mimosa, which was tasty and refreshing. Even though we were already full, the waiter highly recommended the flan and we just couldn't turn it down. The flan was creamy and delectable! It was served with strawberries and little crunchy chocolate pieces.

Every component that makes a restaurant great is to be had in spades at this little gastro-center. The Food: Charleen's creative, local-focused, uber fresh cuisine features a short menu that is anything but on flavor.  Every single flavor combination featured is spot on. The Jidori chicken is hands down the best I've every had, with spaetzle and wildflowers. The chicken is moist, flavorful, and pairs perfectly with the texture and simplicity of the spaetzle. Every single appetizer and entree wows in its own unique way, the only thing longed for is more options once you've eaten everything on the menu. To me, the menu is the perfect balance of simplicity, creativity, flavor, and little bits of heaven.The Wine: All Arizona? Yes. Bad thing? Not at all. With characters like Pavle, Josh, and Emily helping you choose wines that you will enjoy, it's hard to go wrong.  My advice, take their advice- they know what they're talking about and very likely are going to know what works well with which food items. The Service: Perfect. Pavle could make anyone feel welcome and comfortable, and the entire staff has more serving experience than most restaurants in the valley combined. Trust them when they recommend things, believe them when say they know.

It was okay, nothing mind blowing and I probably should have asked if they could turn the heat down a notch. I should know not to get ""curry"" anything unless it's at an authentic Indian restaurant. They served it in cute mini pots. One had the rice and the other had the curry. There was also something they served on the side that i THINK had mangos in it. The sweetness of the mangos really complemented the spicy flavors of the curry and added a cooling effect also. Dessert.Bread Pudding.I've never been a fan of bread pudding, but our waitress (who was super nice and attentive) recommended it and the girl KNOWS what she's talking about. It was hot, cinnamon-y, smooth, and fragrant. Plop on the vanilla ice cream and the deal is DONE. sooooo gooood!I'll definitely come back to this place but maybe not as often since they're a little on the pricey side, which is totally cool because the quality of their food is great. I see a lot of girlfriend lunches at this place in the future!"

We were sat in the rear of the restaurant and meet one of the nicest servers we had during our trip. After a little light conversation we found out she loved our state and was very found of some of our home towns, which made the meal that much better of an experience. Braised rabbit was fantastic and cooked to order with no issues. The tartar ahi tuna we started with was a little too small to share with our group of four, so I do recommend taking another appetizer or side salad as a starter. I sampled a piece of steak from a friend and it was perfectly seasoned and had a spicy taste I was not expecting to find on a simple steak. The wine selection and beer selection is fairly priced compared to similar restaurants.  Overall a great experience, but not for a bachelor parties loud drunken antics, this location is more suited for a quiet or light date like conversation not our bantering.... Still with that in mind the experience was pleasant - 4 stars."

We then split the R&R, a make your own - and a server recommendation - I believe it was a Dynamite ? - I could be wrong. All three were tasty although I still like Nikko a tad better...in terms of  taste of sushi overall and convenience factor. - I will say I seriously choked at one point even though we did ask for the sushi to be cut smaller,  I am afraid of what it would be had I not.

The interior has an aviation motif with large airplanes hanging down from the cEiling. Once we sat down, Brandy was quick to greet us and take our drink order. They have a special going 24/7 for $1 PBR. Pabst might not be the finest beer around, but a dollar is nothing to complain about. Maybe it was the price, or the fact that they serve an ice cold draft in an ice cold pint that makes it that much more enjoyable. When she came back, my friend and I split the Bonnie's BBQ Burger ($7.99) and a Patty Melt ($7.99). The burger was fan-freakin-tastic. A half pound of juicy beef patty cooked to a perfect medium rare stacked with four large onion rings, BBQ sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and three strips of crispy bacon. With the sandwiches you get a choice of fries, onion rings, rice pilaf, potato salad, or some other items. It is ridiculous the variety of sides offered. There is definitely something for everyone. The Patty Melt is served on marbled rye and was good. After biting into the burger, it paled in comparison. We would have been happy with a burger each. I got an order of onion rings with it and they were well seasons, crispy and everything an onion ring should be. It is difficult to find good onion rings because they can be overcooked, doughy, or absorb all the oil. These are the best I have had in a while.Sometimes, I just crave a good burger and some fried goodness. I would be willing to come here again. Especially since they have shuffleboard.

I needed to find a Deli style coffee shop type atmosphere to please my 80 year old grandparents who were visiting for a few days. My grandparents are Polish and Irish but this Jewish Style Bakery/Deli was right up there alley. My Grandpa and I ordered the appetizer size stuffed cabbage because for about $8.00-$9.00 my gramps had a hunch it was a pretty big portion. He was right! It came with rye bread as well. I'm sure the normal portion would be huge for the $12.00-13.00 range. We were very happy with the taste and I was also informed you can get the sauce on the side if you want to add to your desired liking. Another family member enjoyed the Pastrami sandwich which I am looking forward to trying soon.With a few more great meals in the future at this place, I will have to elevate my rating to the 5 Star level. 4 for now until I'm wowed a few more times!"

Superb texture and flavor! Also tried a gyro and gyro plate, along with some falafel, and quality seems to be consistent on the whole menu.

So tempted to give 43rd a 5 star rating because their Pho is just shy of Pho ... nomenal. Yes, I just went there.Coming from San Jose, where Pho restaurants are abundant and witnessing/eating my father's homemade Pho 43rd is on point!I had 43rd bookmarked for a while since moving here and was so glad I decided to grab dinner here yesterday night. I ordered the Pho Tai Chin, which is Pho with sliced flank steak added on top, Soy milk and a Vanilla Macaron with Pandan Ice Cream Sandwich.The Pho Tai Chin, tasted really good. It had the right aromas of spices, good beef stock, really soft flank steak slices and the vegetable plate that came with the Pho was so fresh! The portions are huge too, think large bowl! Crisp bean sprouts, basil, lime wedges and jalapeno slices. The only difference I could taste between 43rd's pho and that of my father's is that theirs is a tad sweet. However, it was really surprising how good it was. Plus, I could not sense nor taste any MSG as I am very sensitive to it. Soy milk was typical and served in a big 16 oz cup. Then on to the Macaron Ice Cream sandwich, the guy saw my roommate and I eyeing the menu and told us that they only had the Red Velvet and Vanilla Macaron flavors but all of the ice cream flavors except for Taro. I decided to go with the Vanilla Macaron with Pandan since the warm flavors seemed to work well with each other. He was so nice to give us recommendations and to tell us about how they sell regular French Macarons on the weekends too! The macaron was not too airy or sweet, nice and chewy with pretty feet. It even had little sprinkles on top! The pandan ice cream was creamy and had little strings of young coconut throughout. Together the flavors were just plain awesome!Definitely check this place out, cheap prices, really authentic Vietnamese Pho, good dessert, awesome staff and you get a free drink on the menu when you Check-In on Yelp!"

It's not strictly vegan, but everything can be made vegan. Unlike every other vegan restaurant in the area, it's not about comfort food or proving that vegan food tastes like ""normal food"". They don't do fake meat and sauces, but instead, focus on vegetables, legumes, nuts spreads, and herbs. If you're unaccustomed to raw food, the menu may seem pretty foreign to you, but still allows for exploration of more nutritious food without any flavors that are too out of the ordinary (unless you only eat fast food). For health aficionados, though, an eatery that leaves you feeling better than when you walked in is gratefully received and appreciated. My currents favorites include The Hercules, a black bean burrito with sweet potatoes, onions, bell peppers, tomatoes, guacamole, and vegan or jack cheese, and the Mediterranean Wrapsody, a sun dried tomato wrap filled with greens, tomato, olives, walnuts, feta, red onion, and raw sun-dried tomato cashew spread. Definitely the more health-nut tasting of the two, this hearty wrap leaves me fully beyond full, but never sick.If you start feeling like you might not have room for dessert, buck up. The chocolates are amazing. All the truffles are naturally sweetened, dark and rich. If you're feeling adventurous, try a raw dessert. Warning: the raw desserts are so filling that they can actually serve as a meal. If you want to try a few things, either go with a group, or prepare to take a lot home.While Chakra 4 may not be suited for everyone's tastes, it's definitely a must-try at least once."

One of the things we wanted to put in the bags was a sleeve of carmel corn. We needed a large amount to fill all of the sleeves. We live in Scottsdale so I called every popcorn shop I could find nearby. The people I spoke to were not very helpful and charged ridiculous prices.  I called Poppa Maize and spoke to the owner.  He quoted me a very reasonable price for the amount we needed and he started making it as soon as we got off the phone. He didn't take my cc # only my name.

Yes, you have to get up early. Yes, they cost a lot of money. But, that's going to happen with all of them. With this being said, we booked this tour because we had a groupon. We paid the extra $20 for breakfast and luch, which I suggest you do. It saves you money and you don't have to worry about finding food. Breakfast is decent at the Omelette house. Lunch is provided to you at the Indian reservation. Our tour guide was Jodie, she was great. She told us a lot of side information about vegetation and animal life. I do have one complaint, but nothing too big. She went on a lecture about giving tips and actually telling you how much to give. This happened more than once and it went on for a good 5-10 minutes at the end of our tour. I understand that not everyone understands or believes that you should tip, but the nagging caused her tip to go down. The bus was old. The seats were hard. When the air turned on, it smelled and you could see how incredibly dirty the vents were. But, it got us there safe and sound. Rumor has it that they'll get new buses after they finish paving the dirt road to the reservation. So, that's an exciting improvement. They give you clear cut times, information, and suggestions. The self guided tour of the canyon was flawless with the information you were given. Being that it is self guided,  you can pick and choose what you do. This saves time and energy. They also show a movie on the way back, which makes the ride feel shorter. Overall, for the price this is a great deal."

I love the zoo and aquarium. They do a tremendous job with upkeep and new additions making it a beautiful zoo. All the cats were out and up close today (except the lions). I was surprised to see that at 1030 they offer an elephant meet and greet. They charge $10 for two pictures with an elephant (today it was Victoria) and you get to pet her. What an awesome experience! What a beautiful, amazing, majestic creature:) ! They made a new area to feature cheetahs and you get a close up of the giraffes and zebras now too. We pursued the monkey house and ventured into the aquarium which is splendid. What colorful fish there are in this world. Kids Kingdom is wonderfully done as well and includes sliding boards and such for the kiddies. The Discovery Pavilion houses stinky bats and reptiles and there is a petting zoo area as well. Oh and don't forget the polar bears (who weren't out when we were there) and the cute sea otters. The zoo and aquarium has made great strides to become amazing (I remember my first grade field trip there) and I love that they continue to improve and grow. The only thing missing a hippo:).

It wasn't too busy when we arrived but by the time we left at around 8 p.m., it was almost full. The maritni list is HUGE! Seriously, I could have spent an hour reading all of the different maritini's. I started off with a Samurai, which was gin, midori and peach snapps. Yummy and super sweet if you like the sugary drinks. The next one I had was the Lychee martini, much more subdued with vodka and lychee puree. I finished of with a cucumber martini which was amazing and refreshing, also a vodka martini. They also had rum martinis, which we didn't try and scotch and wiskey martinis. My husband had a scotch martini, which he said was good, but he still prefers his scotch on the rocks. So the waiter then suggested a new scotch they had in for the scotch tasting dinner which my husband LOVED. On to the food. They brought out bread to start with, homemade white bread and foccacia, with fresh butter shaped into roses and a mango chutney which was very very good. We ordered four *thats right folks* four appetizers to begin with. We had the short ribs over gorgonzola polenta, the calamari, the bruschetta of the day which was topped with escargot and pesto, and the fire and ice shrimp and scallops. Short ribs: Cooked to perfection, the meat was so tender and the polenta had a nice sweetness and the dish was topped with a balsamic reduction.The calamari was good, standard, nothing to write home about. It comes with a delicious sauce though.  The fire and ice shrimp and scallops: Both cooked perfectly and the sauce was seriously to die for, we were slopping it up with the bread. And they removed the tail from the shrimp for you so you dont have to worry about that. Bruschetta: More of the yummy bread toasted with a homemade pesto that was nice and thick and not oily mixed with escargot.This was my first try of escargot and I thought it was delicious.We ordered the sea bass to split for an entree. OMG. This was honestly the best fish I have ever had. It was crusted with seasame and topped with a citrus ponzu. It melted like butter and exploded with flavor in my mouth. YES! It was served with a side of mashed yukon golds and a vegetable medly. The owner is the chef and his wife, also the owner, is the pastry chef. She came out and explained all the deserts to us and said she changes them up regularly. She also explained how she doesnt like to use a lot fo refined sugar and like to use things like raisins and fruit to sweeten things. We ordered the chefs tasting and it had carrot cake, creme brulee, bread pudding and baked alaska. It was all heavenly and she was a delight to speak to.

Really good!Tried both the truffle mushroom pizza ($12) and the garlic pizza ($10).  They were both good but the truffle mushroom was beyond good- highly recommend it!The service was friendly and attentive as well.  All around winner.

That was just way too much food to handle. For those of you that don't know. ""The Kitchen Sink"" pretty much has everything in it. I can't even tell you what the ingredients are because the description just says. ""For adventurers only, this one really has it all."" It's also the only omelet on the menu that comes in a size large and you can't get it in any other size. My oatmeal came out right away. It was in a regular size bowl with raisins, brown sugar, butter, and cream on the side. I mixed everything in and started chowing down. To be honest, this was the first time I've ever ordered oatmeal anywhere. I normally just eat oatmeal at home and feel like it's overpriced at restaurants, but I was craving it and it was only $2.99 (a great value for the amount you get). The texture was nice. It wasn't too thick, too watery, or too grainy, just right. I ate about half of it when the omelet came out. It was seriously huge and literally had EVERYTHING in it. It doesn't say it on the menu, but Mamie P. stated down below that it's made with SIX eggs. No wonder it's giant. I saw carrots, bell peppers, mushrooms, chili, hotdogs, cheese, bacon, ham, turkey, onions, broccoli...I'm guessing everything that's listed as ingredients for all the other omelets is in this omelet. It also come with spuds on the side and you choice of carbs, e.g. tortillas, toast, English muffin, pumpkin bread, or banana nut bread. We went with the banana nut, which was delicious and fresh. The spuds look like potato chips, but they're thicker and soft. Don is a potato freak, so he enjoyed them. The omelet was just a little too much for me, especially after eating half of my oatmeal. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty tasty with the mixture of all the meats and veggies, but I was just too full to enjoy it. If we ONLY ordered the omelet, I think I would've really liked it. Don enjoyed the amount of mushrooms it had in it and the Filipino in him really loved the hotdogs as well. I really suggest you only get ""The Kitchen Sink"" if you're splitting it between at least two people and that's all you're ordering. You should also be fine with the amount of random ingredients that are in it. It's kind of like an ""ghetto"" omelet in which everything is just thrown into. All in all, I like this place. The menu is very broad, they have about 40 or so omelets, and the service is fast and friendly. I noticed there were a lot of regulars when I went, so it almost felt like having breakfast at someone's house (not in an awkward way). When we were walking out I even noticed a cookie jar that was just like the cookie jar my mom had in our kitchen when I was little (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/s4JjYgLO5dGUUV9Op4YBrw/l.jpg). It was literally the same exact one. I didn't say anything, but ten seconds later, Don said, ""Dude, that's the same cookie jar my mom had when I was little."" So we learned that we had something in common as kids. Next time, I'll stick to a smaller omelet though, or maybe stuffed French toast and definitely another piece of their banana nut bread ;)"

He kept asking me when I showed him pictures if i wanted the ""victoria secret look,"" not having high hopes after many bad experiences, i said sure.  I ended up with one of the best cuts ever! I have never liked my hair long because it is so thick and heavy it lays so flat, he cut into it so it has more volume and yet all the dead ends are gone without losing any length!

Regular shoes ain't cutting it and he thought he used to walk a lot before, but now it's just killing him. They have you step onto a pad that reads your foot pressure so they can suggest shoes and insoles based on evening out those pressure points. Kinda cool. The insoles were uncomfortable, but she was explaining that when your foot has never hit pressure on other points, it's going to feel odd and sensitive. In a way, you have to break in the foot to step in a different way. The girl was super friendly, detailed and no pressure. The BF wanted to continue searching and researching what is best for him to get the pressure off his back so we didn't grab shoes then, but I think it's a good spot for comfort shoes. It's not cheap as the shoes were $150ish and the insoles were $60, but comfort is a invaluable thing."

Avoid on weekends because it's crowded by families and  screaming children so everywhere is packed and there are large ques. They also bang on the animal cages to ""make them do something."" I hate that. And I think the animals do too.I came here for my course and truly enjoyed this sunny outing, even though I haven't really decided if I am a fan of zoos or not. Edinburgh zoo boasts a huge selection of species. It has a lot of penguins , including a knighted penguin of Norway (a King penguin named Sir Nil Olav who was awarded an honorary colonel-in-chief of the Kings Guard in the Norwegian army, and was knighted in 2008- its true there's even a statue of him!). I still don't know why they did this but the video of him being knighted and walking down a red carpet is hilarious. Speaking of walking ,some penguins go for a walk at particular times of the day(check their website for more details!). Feeding time is also quite amusing to watch. All in all the penguins seem very happy.Not so much their lonely polar but I read yesterday that there are plans for cheering him up by finding him a girl bear friend. Yay!Amongst the many animals you can see here (from koalas to large cats to reptiles and bats) I would suggest reading up a bit about one particular resident: the honey badger- Personally I am absolutely fascinated by this tough creature- one of the toughest in the world who sadly gets overshadowed in the zoo by his pretty cat neighbour. Also, make sure you check out the new Budongo Trail, which hosts a variety of our closest relatives, the primates, and is an educational experience for all ages.So as for a conclusion regarding zoos, I have yet to come to one. Edinburgh zoo does seem to be making the effort though to keep its standards high and its residents as happy as possible, and it definitely is a fun outing to make."

I made reservations about a week ahead of time asking them for a fountain side seat. They told me they couldn't guarantee my seat and said I should come early.I recommend parking with the valet service at Paris. Either you or your date will be wearing something nice and heels so you probably won't want to walk in those. The self parking lot is pretty darn far away (about a 7 minute walk) so skimping on the valet tip isn't worth it. We got the following: +pea soup (6.5/10) Very distinct taste. Came with some fish which was very delicious. +foie gras (7/10) portion was very small but delicious. It was very flavorful but a bit on the salty side. +blue cheese souffle (7/10) Delicious. The souffle was scrumptious. +lamb chops (9/10) M girlfriend said this is the best lamp she's ever had. +chocolate souffle (9/10) Very delicious and full of chocolate flavor. Our server poked holes into the souffle and then pour chocolate syrup inside. +espressoOur total came out to $132.42. A great deal for a good view, fine dining and a relaxing atmosphere. I'd have to say the lamb was very delicious. My girlfriend said that it was the best lamb she's ever had. I thought it was pretty good myself. It was flavorful and not very gamy.  I read a few other reviews commenting that the lamb was a bit tough. My girlfriend and I like our meat rare so I asked the waiter to serve it as rare as they could get away with. The blue cheese souffle was pretty good but not as good as the chocolate souffle. We ordered it early so we'd get it after our lamb chops. The entire dinner was roughly 2 hours. I'd give yourself 2 hours if in case you're budgeting your time. We had a Cirque du Soliel to run to so we paced ourselves to leave in 1 hour and 45 minutes. We sat at the very corner seat closest to the Bellagio fountains. We are from 700-900 and saw at least 5 fountain shows. I think this place has the best fountain shows.

The staff were very pleasant and showed to our table and we got onto deciding what to eat rom the fairly extensive pizza menu.To balance our meal, we started we a platter of vegetable antipasti to share. It said 2-3 people on the menu, and they were certainly not lying.  We didn't even finish as we needed space for our pizza!  For pizza, we opted for a 'four seasons' and a 'diablo' that we shared.

The store was downright sophisticated, all the items were organized well enough that anyone coming in would get a chance to check every single product out. I came here upon my galpal's recommendation to try the shea butter hand lotion. Upon my inquiry, the saleslady was friendly enough to offer me a sample and led me to displays of other scented hand lotions among which were lavender, rose and cherry blossom. You could pick the 1oz tube for $10. It may sound a bit pricey but I promise you, it is worth it! Your hands will feel impeccably smooth and considering how dry it is here in Vegas, there's no harm giving this a try! You don't need to use a whole lot of it to get the smooth effect anyway so this product would be a better investment contrary to drugstore brands which dry off before you know it. While checking out their hand lotions, make sure to wander off to the perfume areas too where you could enjoy spraying yourself using an old vintage puffer which I find super chic."

With that said, I would rate Dickey's as one of the best chain BBQ restaurants that I Have experienced. The art of a chain restaurant obviously starts in the kitchen with the ability to mass produce a product in one location or  standardize a recipe and distribute in another location with minimal effort for the staff, requiring a lower pay scale to support the almighty bottom line. From what I could see they use a vacuum sealed bag product that merely needs to be reheated. However the art is in fulfilling the taste buds and creating the illusion of freshly made product. This was accomplished! The second part of a successful chain that is control-able is  the staff interaction and presence with the customer. For this I give Dickey's in Scottsdale a ten+. I was there on the 4th of July; working holidays is always the worst part of the restaurant industry. The staff showed no signs of animosity towards being there on a holiday. To the contrary the staff added to my holiday experience! I also enjoyed the unlimited self sever BBQ sauce bar with whole dill pickles and soft serve ice cream! Well done Dickey's and staff!"

I actually have been eating at Boston Market for many years, We would go to the valleys original location in Tempe, and back then it was a great place. Over the years I saw the quality fade and the flavors go south. I chalked that up to growth and just chose other dining options.On last nights visit I was greeted by a friendly young lady who had that great ""we are happy you are here"" smile. I was happy that she helped guide me through side selections so I could get a side salad and fresh steamed veggies with The Half Chicken Special.After ordering I noticed that the drink and condiment station was well stocked and clean, as was the dining room. I found a table and within seconds my meal was brought to me by the same friendly cashier. The meal was Hot and smelled delicious, The steamed veggies were cooked perfect and on the same quality level as most high end restaurants in this town. The side Caesar salad was fresh and yummy and at no extra cost! WOW! The Star of the night though was the perfectly cooked and seasoned chicken. I was so impressed with the plates and utensils because the were real. No plastic and paper, that was a nice touch.Places like this have teams of executives that work hard to make sure there unit teams perform and execute meals and guest satisfaction like I had last night. Well somebody's doing there job and THAT'S FRESH!!!!I recommend Boston Market if you have never been or haven't been in a while. It has to be the best meal in town under 10 bucks!"

Needing a car to get around I decided to use Enterprise Rent-A-Car off of Via De Ventura since its close to where I live.  I spoke with Sam who had their driver Ignacio pick me up and take me to the rental location.  Before I go on, I have to say that Sam and Ignacio were very friendly and helpful; definitely represented Enterprise with their customer service.  Anyway, so after getting to Enterprise I worked with the district manager Mike on renting a car for the whole weekend at a great weekend price of $9.99 - which I thought was a steal.  Mike was very polite and although he offered me the insurance for renting the car, which I obviously declined- Mike was not pushy or rude about it.  Unlike my last experience with Enterprise just a week prior at the Dallas Love Fied location.  The Love Field rental agent irritated me with his pushy antics.  So after having the car for a few hours, my mechanic at Whitey's Auto Repair called and said that my car was fixed and that it wouldn't take the whole weekend.  I was obviously excited, but felt embarassed to have rented the car for the whole weekend and now would have to return it early.  I called and spoke to Mike, who was totally understandable and laughed with me on the phone.  He easily took the car back with no issues and even had their cool driver Ignacio drop me off at the mechanic shop.  Overall I was surprised at the dedication and customer service Mike, Sam and Ignacio offer here at the Via De Ventura location.  This will definitely be my first choice for car rental locations in the Scottsdale area."

The hot dog is wrapped in bacon crammed with beans tomatoes and more especially that you could add more toppings. Of course you may ask, how can a hot dog bread hold so much food without falling apart and that is because it does not use a hot dog bun it uses another type of bread. I think it might have been a ""bolillo"" type bread. ""Whoa whoa!!!"" some might say ""a hot dog without the classic type hot dog bread?"" has the whole world gone crazy!!! Well believe this a Sonoran Dog doesn't fit in a classic hot dog bun because it doesn't belong in a classic hot dog bun. There is no secrete formula to these animals, in all possibility some might say there is nothing special about these, ""I can make that from home."" type thought from those fancy critics. One thing is for sure you can not make the atmosphere like this from home, sitting on a street corner at night is not a common thing in fact kinda adds a risky edge. Saw a few kind of gypsy looking people walk by and immediately I imagined my self eating a hot dog in one of those dangerous cities from Mexico you hear about. such as hint hint Nogales.

I've seen that a lot of fellow Yelpers have gone here, and its recieved quite a few reviews.  So, I call the place to confirm where they are located, and what time they are open until.  A nice gentleman with an Italian accent answered the phone, and was so friendly and helpful!  I loved it!  So, I drive there, and like the gentleman said, he was right off the expressway next to a circle K.  What shocked me at first was a few things.  First, its a tiny little parking lot, and its shared with a circle K.  I found this interesting.  Fortunately, there was parking available, so I waited for my friend to arrive.  The second surprise that I had was just how small this place was.  Interesting.  I guess if you had a larger party (more then 4 people) you would definately NEED to call in a reservation, as its a very limited seating arrangement.When my friend finally arrived, all the seats were taken, and I was greeted by the gentleman with the thick Italian accent.  He told me that it would be about a 7 minute wait, so my friend and I waited outside in the parking lot.   The wait ended up being more about 10 minutes, maybe 15 tops.  Not bad.When we were seated, we really liked the place.  Theres a firebrick oven where people were cooking pizzas.  There was also other workers that you could see preparing other foods.  Somewhat of an open kitchen feel.  the service was great.  I believe this place is owned and operated by this Italian family.  they most be brothers, because periodically throughout the evening, they were speaking in Italian to each other.  I think it really added to the evening, and made the place feel much more authentic.We ended up ordering our food, and even tho I was not extremely hungry, my friend was.   I went with a Cesar Salad, and my friend went with the Cheese Ravioli.  We were given some complimentary appitizers which were bread chunks and red sauce. Tasty!  We both ordered pops, which were brought out and poured for us...but they were from those 20 ounce pop bottles that you would get at a local store...not from a fountian. I found this interesting.Angie really enjoyed her Ravioli, but I felt like my salad was a little soggy.  Sitll edable, just a little to much dressing.  The food here seems to be good, and I think its also the ambiance and guys that run the show that make dining here worthwhile.  I would bring friends or family here who are in from out of town, becuase I think its one of those more authentic experiences.Anyways, the service was wonderful.  Truely a gem, and much more fun and authentic then most places I have been for pizza and pasta lately."

Many Asians the night that I went but that's perfectly fine as they were so cute and absolutely gentlemen like.  Bartenders were very attentive and the outdoor theme was great, surreal... I love this club, great service and pleasurable clientele.  I got into the club VIP style by paying a bit extra but it was sooOOoo worth it. We were lead into the club by a ""hook-up"" and it was perfect.  Music was great, not much more to say about it besides that anyone going to Las Vegas should just go :) Mr. Wynn is probably a douche, but great job on the club :)"

To be honest, I came here because I was looking at stocks to invest in and I read that Potbelly was good. My impression? They are so good that I feel bad for the Wildflower bread company a few shops down. Don't get me wrong, Wildflower is good, and is great for business lunches or perhaps bringing your parents to; but for the average Joe who just wants a cheap, delicious, lunch, you can't compete with Potbelly in terms of price vs quality. I think Potbelly will steal a lot of customers away from Wildflower who don't feel like paying 7-10 bucks for a sandwich. Great place. Amazing chicken and cheddar sandwich."

The food is absolutely delish! My go-to is the chicken beer bread sandwich. While the beer bread is actually more like a flat bread and doesn't have a strong beer flavor, I cannot get enough of it! They should cut it up in triangles and serve it as an app!! They have enormous hearty salads and other really good dishes too, but I still can't veer from that sandwich- which is easily big enough for 2 to share.Oh, and how could I forget about dessert? There is an oatmeal stout milkshake that is different, yet oh-so-good, even for those that despise beer (this has been tested out).If you're ever around ASU- and even if you have to drive a half hour (or more) to get here, it is worth it.

For my appetizer I got the beef carpaccio with field greens, parmesan and truffle oil - it was amazing...my favorite part of the evening.  Then, I had the New York steak Diane with potatoes, fried onions and carrots - the steak tasted like Filipino barbecue but with a nice semi-spicy kick at the end.  For dessert, I had the apple galette with a spoon-shaped tulle - it wasn't overly sweet which was nice.The place is nice and you can watch the chefs/ students prepare your food.  It's like watching live Hell's Kitchen without the cursing and yelling.  I was entertained and I wish I was as good as the Le Cordon Bleu chefs or had their kitchen so I can do crazy stuff.On the way to the restroom are glass windows where you can see students practice different knife cuts.

As for the tanning beds, they're high quality and effective. If you're unsure which bed you should be in depending on which day you come in (might want to alternate for a better color) there is always friendly service so they'll be happy to say what they recommend. I myself recommend that you go by their recommendations, they know exactly what they're talking about when it comes to how long you should be in there for and which bed you should use.

No one in the place doesn't worry me, walking in it had already seemed so charming and smelled great.

This was plenty for a lunch dish, and very tasty. The avocado cream was a great touch. Tacos $12 flavor profile 4/5This was nice because you could choose any 3 tacos you'd like from the options and it was one fixed price. I order 1 fish and 3 shrimp. Both served grilled and you prepared the taco yourself. Presentation was nicely done with all of the toppings on the side. I don't like runny fish or shrimp tacos, so this was perfect for me. You could also order the whole taco deep fried, but I did not choose this option. Beers $5 corona light and modelo I can't wait to come back.

Cost is average to what you normally pay at buffets, about $45-60? I think we got a decent discount for using our Total Rewards card. Seafood - AMAZING! Oh so fresh & delicious - halibut (buttery & melts in your mouth) & sashimi (restaurant quality, fresh tasting). Everything else was just as great! Lots of stuff to choose from. Dessert section was probably my favorite, I wanted to eat EVERYTHING!! I loved the fresh souffle, made to order crepes and  large selection of gelato ice cream flavors.

Needless to say after about 10 minutes in the sun it was warm and undrinkable. I think when we go again (can't wait) we will just get beer from one of the vendors that have bottle in ice and not draft. I think it would have been perfect then."

They also had some uninspiring Asian food and a pizza area..not necessary  for me but I guess somebody would like it.

The quality and service this store offers is absolutely amazing. The store is owned by a husband and wife team and they take such pride in their product. I didn't want to spend too much on a wedding dress but I really loved the Watters collection and they are the best location to go when searching for this designer. They were so helpful and treated me like a princess from the moment I stepped in the store. I was nervous to come b/c I knew that I wouldn't be spending as much as the typical bride and I didn't want to feel out of place. They made me feel sooooo incredibly comfortable and found me the perfect dress for $1200 off the price that it originally was. The assistant that they have working there is so sweet also. She is in fashion design school and had some great ideas to complete the look of my dress. My sister came here for when she was looking to get married 2 years ago and after that experience I knew that when it came my turn there was no other place I would want to go. They made the day really magical and I am so thankful for the professional and superior service. GET YOUR WEDDING DRESS HERE! YOU WONT REGRET IT!

We upgraded to white meat on the chicken for an additional $2 each but it worth every penny. I think this is the best fried chicken I've ever eaten, with excellent flavor down to the bone. The grits were tasty and the waffles had a hint of cinnamon. Definitely a good mixture as they compliment each other.

I slowly became a coffee drinker since the winter in SLC was pretty long and chilly :) I was introduced to this great coffee shop called, 'Salt Lake Roasting Co.' which is located in downtown area. I loved this place because of their cozy atmosphere and the great taste of coffee. I am very happy to find out that Sambalatte is opened in town :)   My favorite aspect of Sambalatte is the atmosphere!!  Just like the one(SLRC) in SLC...The downstairs is a little bit bigger than the upstairs area (loft style, big wooden table with a plenty of comfy chairs & sofas, board games, books, magazines, & new papers are available to use). There are various sizes of tables you can set up on free wi-fi as well, awesome!! If you are a espresso drinker, I recommend a 'Affogato with Vanilla Gelato'-it's simply put, a shot of espresso with a scoop of your choice of gelato in it.  I usually get a regular coffee(Sumatra) and it is divine! When I order my coffee, the barista pours water over the coffee bean grounds, stirring them, and pouring the water (A hand drip coffee, yay :P)  But more importantly, the service was out of this world. All the staff were friendly, nice, and helpful. They also provide you a drink card (ask a barista before you pay). It is a great local coffee option if you want to do your work or hang out in a relaxed atmosphere.  You don't get hassled or interrupted."

Very pleasant :) Like a Canadian version of an East Village spot, complete with patrons you would see milling around St. Marks. Saw a sign that said they have Open Mic on Mondays and when I was there on....Friday(?) they had a live band setting up....good stuff. Sweet Potato Burrito was crack. Seriously delicious. The reason I came back for more. My sister got the Chili burrito and liked it but said it was too spicy (not for my taste buds...how do i know? i finished it for her ^_^). Not crazy about the quinoa...it was too light and fresh for me which isn't even a relevant complaint lol, I just like my quinoa to be heavier and more savory. Drinks were yummy, I tried the raspberry lemonade and we had the root beer. Didn't find it expensive at all, but maybe that's cuz I'm a tourist and not really privy to the places that sell good food for less than $12. I would def come back here on my next trip to Montreal. Sidenote: the dudes who work here look like hipster models. Actually, most of the men in Montreal do. Whats up with that? It's freakish how many handsome men are walking around that city."

You can upgrade for a few dollars more if you wanted to for a better car wash.  They have a 48 hour rain policy.  Which means if rains within that time, you can bring your car back in.  I did get a wash here when it was close to dark, they took awhile because most of the workers went home, so when they were done, they apologized for the delay and said if it wasn't to my satisfaction in the light to bring it back the next day.  What was most impressive on our most recent visit was how they cleaned our second hand car, they were very detailed and seriously got in the itty bitty spots you wouldn't think to clean.

We went here for a bachelorette party and had a blast. We had regular tickets but when we arrived with the bride dressed in her bachelorette gear we were upgraded to VIP seats. We sat front row center! The host was very nice. The woman who opened the show was a local comedian and she was hilarious. At that moment we realized why we were front row center- so she could rip apart the bride- awesome!! There were three other comics performing and they were all very very funny. We laughed the entire time. The drinks were good, not watered down. I have no clue how much they cost because we were all beyond a little tipsy! The club was very clean and classy looking. After the show was over the comedians were all in the lobby. We got to meet them all, talk with them, take pictures and get autographs. It made for a very fun night and I will be returning with my husband. We would also take visiting friends and family here. I will say that the tickets were a little pricey for the Tropicana, but I did feel like I got my moneys worth."

I must admit that the only reason I go there is to play disc golf and because this is a review of the park it might seem a bit odd.If you are looking to play a game of target practice and maybe take out a small child or two you should probably try playing disc golf on the weekends as there are almost always large parties and groups of people who show little to no respect for the fact that there is a disc golf course and just assume they can frolic anywhere. Major thumbs down for this even though the course itself is fun.As an above average disc golfer I feel that this course is great for beginners, but anyone with a high skill level will find out quickly that the Pars are basically tailored towards newer players. Add in the fact that some of the signs are either stolen or scratched out to the point of being illegible and there are some flaws. As long as you are just going to have fun this place can be a blast, and if you take out a few ignorant people along the way it's just one big bonus. Happy hunting!"

I got what I usually get, a burger (Pterodactyl Burger west side style in this case), half order of fried pickles, and banana pudding at the end. Everything is just as good as I remember, all of it made even better by the free Yuengling, though I hope they get their ABC license soon just so I can have a variety to choose from. First test passed.My second trip I wanted to try something new so I tried the fish taco. Not the best I`ve had in Charlotte but, pretty darn good. Personally I think I will stick with just ordering burgers in future, but it's always good to have choices. Second test passed, but with a slightly lower grade.On top of the good food this place is alot closer to where I live now! I like the location, just the parking is horrible.

But here at Hachi, everything is just.. good.  Not great.  Good.I've been to Hachi many times and as with many restaurants out their, they've catered to our slumbering economy by dumbing down their menu.  They now have a section in the menu that features small, tapas-type dishes for people who aren't too hungry or that on a very strict budget.  The sushi is still very good; they have a sushi roll with mango on top which I think everyone should try... when mango is in season :)"

I love the cozy island decor.  There is a bar and plenty of booth seating.  We haven't had to wait to be seated either time we've been here. The pizza is different.  If you're craving your basic pizza and comparing that to Balboa I don't think this is going to cut it.  But if you order with an open mind expecting a unique pizza (which is smaller than your typical pie) then I think you'll be pleased.  So far we've tried three cheese and Philly cheesesteak pies and they're delicious.  The best time to go is on Tuesdays when the pizzas are BOGO with a one drink purchase per pie.  The last time, I got water and my husband ordered 2 beers and we were able to get the deal.  The homemade chips are incredible.  I will definitely be craving them.  Fried mozzarella was OK - nothing special.  We've been here twice and the service is very quick.  The servers are friendly, albeit sometimes dismissive.  I asked for a ginger ale and the waitress said they could make it with sprite and a splash of coke... she mentioned that this was the ginger ale most bars served.  Not in my experience.  And if I'm craving a ginger ale, there'd be one pretty obvious taste missing from that mixture... ginger.  Also, the same server accidentally spilled my glass of iced water on me and I had to walk out with a wet (white) t-shirt.  A walk of shame if I've ever had one LOL.  She was apologetic as she handed me the check.  This will be on our ""Tuesday rotation"" and maybe other days occasionally if we're at the District and wanting some food and drink."

The casino is pretty large and they offer all of the card games and slot machines. I stayed in the Bella Suite which was very spacious. The bathroom was also quite spacious and had a two sink vanity, make-up area for her, a jacuzzi tub and a separate shower. The room also has two double beds and a sectional couch that can turn into a pull-out bed. There's also two TV's, because only having one is just a waste... **When looking at the mini bar/snack selection is the room, DO NOT TOUCH IT! I heard that it has weight censors, so if you move it then they will charge you for ""eating"" or ""drinking"" the item. The only downside to the Palazzo is that they do not have a food court so if you want some quick food, you have to walk to The Venetian.

Sounds like that poor man really hit House of Tricks on a bad night.

I certainly hope that they hit this page, and fix their inconsistencies, because it has been a great place.I am from Ohio and have had the pleasure to eat at HoTs twice.  The first was in 2005.  I was taken there by a bank during a business trip.  We were a group of eight.  We ate at a large round table outside, which in my opinion is the only place to eat.  Honestly, I have never been inside HoTs.They have a full bar outside, high-top tables and bar seating which is  open (non-reserved) seating.  There are misters that cool the Tempe air to a comfortable temperature.  As a couple of other reviewers mentioned it is an intimate and romantic atmosphere.  The dress is very casual, you could go with shorts and t-shirts, but most wear business professional clothing which would be more appropriate for the atmosphere.My experience in 2005 was excellent.  The service was attentive, the food was AMAZING!  All eight of us thoroughly enjoyed our dishes.  Their wine selection is very good, and the bar drinks are very generous and their liquor selection is great.So last October 2010 my dad and I had flown to Salt Lake City on business and were stranded by the airline in PHX.  I was SO EXCITED!!  My father LOVES restaurants like HoTs, so I was set on taking him there.  I called to see if they had a table for two and found out they were booked.  The hostess told me that they had three high top tables at the outdoor bar that were first come first served, they were open, and if we didn't wait too long one of them could be ours.  My dad was kind of tired, and really just wanted to stay at the hotel, but I wasn't taking no for an answer.  We hailed a cab and off we went.  I was so hoping that it had not changed and the food would be as good as it was five years before and I was not disappointed.  Better yet, my dad LOVED it!  It was just as I remembered.  Great menu selections, creative and inventive dishes which were well executed.  Wonderful mixed drinks, great wine selection.  I don't usually eat dessert, but we both ordered desserts which were wonderful and perfectly sized.The staff was wonderful, the hostess kept stopping by our table just randomly to ask if we were having a good time, and checking to see if we needed anything.  I believe she was the one I spoke to on the phone, and she also greeted us when we arrived.  I explained to her that I had been there five years before and was so excited to be able to bring my dad.  She really went out of her way to make us feel welcome.I have told many friends about HoTs, and I really hope to get back there someday soon."

I haven't checked out that selection yet but the prices seem to be pretty fair from the signs that they've had up.The employees were very friendly, asked us if we were 21 or older and pretty much took our word for it.  They may have checked my friend's ID but I don't recall.  As we definitely look older than 21 it wasn't really a careless overlook by them, just trying not to pester us about the obvious.  We brought along my friend's 4 year old son and he was pleasantly entertained by who appeared to be the manager, who asked him his name and proceeded to carry out a conversation with the voice of Donald Duck, classic!  He made sure that we were finding everything okay and told us if we needed help with anything just to let him know, the type of service I'd say most of us prefer in this setting.The prices were pretty good and the female cashiers (one in her 30s, one older) were both friendly and even offered the kid a lollipop, nice touch.

I had bought my Rhonda Allison product here at SWINA when my person who did my facials went out of business. I checked the reviews for the students and decided to give it a try.I was booked with Tina for a basic facial ($33). She greeted me right away, gave me some paperwork to fill out and showed me back to the ""room"". I got comfy under the covers and the fun began! She started the facial, checked my skin and got her instructor to review the results. She asked me if I would like to upgrade to the Skin Brightening facial and I thought it would be a great idea (I had wanted to do this anyway but forgot to change it with my reservation). She did an absolutely WONDERFUL job keeping things nice and peaceful while she did the facial and she did a great job with the foot, hand and shoulder massages. This was the best hour I have had in a long time.Afterwards, she gave me a sheet with the recommendations and I was able to get my new products and be on my way. This was a very relaxing hour and did a great deal to recharge my batteries. I would highly recommend the facials to anyone."

I absolutely love the atmosphere at this location, it never gets too crowded and it's always clean. Compared to the Town Square location, it's always busy and always out of place to sit. The workers are very friendly, and I had the pleasure to meet the owners of this location, and they were nice and even offered me coupons.When it comes to the yogurt, this place became my place for sweet tooth. I'm not really a fan of ice cream places much,so Yogurtland is my alternative. I love the flavors that they offer, including my most fave the Taro and Coconut. As far as toppings they have a variety of sweets, from fruits, chocolate to sweet sprinkles. I love the fruits they offer and every time i come in it's always stocked, so can't really complain there. Oh, as a plus I think they are the only yogurt place that i've been to (and i've been to a lot, cherry on top, u-swirl, i love yogurt,etc ) that offer condensed milk, which is pretty good on your fruit toppings. Overall, YogurtLand is by far the no#1 in my list of places to go to for yogurt. Currently, they have Sanrio character theme going on which is a hit with the kids and some adults too. So if you're looking for a place to chill and cool down around the Summerlin area, I recommend this place to the T!"

They are about a 5 min drive from my house, and they have free delivery since I'm usually too lazy to make that drive. Their pizza is super tasty, and it's cut into squares so you get those 4 fun trianglie corner pieces along with the big square pieces! I like that it has a thin crust that is light and crispy with out tasting like a saltine or melba toast. Its the perfect combo of crisp and soft. The cheese they use is divine as well. they always use the perfect amount and it's just the right amount of saltiness and greasyness. I like their sausage, however I believe they make it home made? Sometimes it's too fennel-ie for me, so I don't really order it anymore. Their specialty pizzas are also very good. And their cheese sticks. Yum! I like that they are called cheese sticks, and not mozzarella sticks or fried mozzarella or other ""fancy"" names like that. They are just delicious sticks of cheese that happen to be fried and taste like heaven. I always want to try their wings, but have yet to since I am not yet sick of the cheese sticks. I haven't tried any of the pasta dishes yet, either, but would like to. My boyfriend always gets their sandwiches for lunch and I have been lucky enough to eat his left overs from time to time (I work too far away for lunch time treats from Little Chicago unfortunately).

First, lets talk about the store:  You never walk in without a greeting and an explanation of your popcorn choices.  They are more than happy to let you sample any popcorn and it may just persuade you to buy that flavor - it is that good!Second, lets talk about the old school candies:  There are bins of candies everywhere.  I love looking at all the candy that was available when I was a kid - enough said ... I won't disclose my age unless you ask :)Finally, lets talk about the product:  Yummy and beautifully packaged.  I brought samples to a client, so they could decide what to send their clients and it turned into an office party - that is what good popcorn does for the soul!Oh, and don't forget to check out the fish talk from the TV Show ""Tanked"""

We ordered two appetizers:Corn chowder, which was delicious, filled with sweet corn, cream, and king crab.Fresh oysters, which were indeed fresh, briny and terrific. For entrees, my wife ordered a filet mignon.  It was cooked and seasoned perfectly and my wife declared that it was one of the best steaks she has ever had.  We've tried many dozens of high-end steak houses around the country and specifically in Las Vegas, so that is saying a lot. I ordered a bone-in dry-aged strip steak, kind of pricey at $54, but also cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Charlie Palmer also has an excellent wine list although the wine prices are exorbitant, but you'll definitely find a good bottle or two on the list.Bring a shawl or wrap if you are sensitive to a draft and cool temperatures.

Never hesitate to put a paper clown on his back!!!!I shot up a paper zombie clown with an uzi, and loved every second of it! Here's a few tips for your visit, should you decide to bite the bullet and head over to The Gun Store... First off, get there early if you can. This is very touristy, and it gets crazzzzzzy busy. When we got there, there were a ton of people in line already, I asked about how long, they said it was about an hour wait, it turned out to be just about that. By the time we left there was double the line. It's expensive! However, if you live in state with gun laws that prevent you from getting your hands on fully automatic weapons like I do, then I'd say its totally worth it! Plan to spend $50 to shoot one automatic, and $99-160 for a package of 3-4 different guns (comes with a souvenir t-shirt). They have a ladies package that came with 3 guns, one of them was a pink AR-15, and you couldn't put a price on the look of that girls face when she was shooting that bad boy! She was smiling for a good hour afterwards!My other friends opted for the WW2, and Zombie packages, all the guns were awesome! If I had a ton of money, I would get the shoot the wall package, which was $399 and came with 11 machine guns... OOOOH YEAH! The loudest thing we heard fired in the range was the M249 SAW, next time I'm shootin that bad boy! On a side note, I had read some of the reviews of the gun store, and was fully expecting to be treated like dirt by a bunch of cocky employees, but everyone we encountered was super friendly. They are all strapped though, so don't get out line in here! ;)****Disclaimer: Prices mentioned above are subject to change without notice. As mentioned by Shawn A, do not arrive drunk, you will be asked to leave. The opinions expressed above are the views of the writer (thats me yo!) and do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of other Yelper's, employees of the gun store, Nevada state gun board (does that even esist?), or any Las Vegas casino's including but not limited to the O'Sheas Casino, which completely funded my experience at The Gun Store. Although we experienced no issues, I do not recommend going to the gun store directly before you head back to the airport to catch your flight home, as you will be dusted in gunpowder during your experience inside the shooting range. Special thanks go out to the roulette dealer at O'Sheas Casino, and the employees of The Gun Store. Thank you, and you stay classy Las Vegas!"

I probably won't, but I hope that won't hurt my chances with him anyway.  I need to keep relations good since he's at the top of my Ross-and-Rachel-esque Top 5 Celebrities You Can Cheat With list.  Yes, he's my Dorothy Hamill. We dined here as a party of 10 on a 10:00 pm reservation, and the experience was wholly pleasant and pleasurable.  The staff was consummately gracious and professional throughout the entire meal.  I've eaten places where we've arrived shortly before closing like this, and the servers could not have been -- or overtly acted -- more put-out.  Not the case at all at Craftsteak.  In fact, no one batted an eye, and our server David treated us like we were his only table and like he was beyond pleased to attend to our every little need.  When we left the restaurant (the absolute last party to depart), all the staff thanked us for coming and bid us good-night.  And they actually seemed genuine.Our dinner was pretty darn phenomenal.  Most of the top-of-the-line ingredients come from local or small farms (even spotted some oysters from Virginny!).  Three of the diners raved it was the best meal they'd ever had anywhere.  I didn't feel *quite* that way, but it definitely approached dining Nirvana.  I was just really excited to be able to partake in Colicchio's famously prepared steak: there was a farm-raised grass-finished bison striploin on the menu that I jumped on as a newfound ""ethical flexitarian"" (I can hear you guys groaning, you know).  It was 42 bucks.  By itself.  The entire menu is ÌÊ la carte, in true upscale steakhouse fashion.  Was it worth 42 bones?  Probably not.  Was it fabulous?  Absolutely: cooked exactly to my specifications, tender and juicy, robust with flavor, seasoned perfectly, and seared to a beautiful crust on the outside.We started with some salads: warm frisÌ©e with a soft poached egg and lardons of chewy bacon, and peppery arugula with toasted pine-nuts.  I really dislike eggs in most of their forms, but when this farm-fresh egg split and oozed over the frisÌ©e, something special happened...and I had a bite.  For their mains others sampled beef filet and ribeye, surf and turf with lobster, and the chilled seafood plate.  Everyone swooned.  The table shared roasted asparagus with lemon (fine, but uninspiring); roasted corn with herbs and scallions (this tasted, I kid you not, *exactly* like SunChips -- fine-dining, blow-your-mind SunChips); mushroom risotto (creamy, decadent, punctuated by sweet, fresh peas and topped with crisp chanterelles); and fried squash blossoms (way too rich and oily for most everyone's taste).When David discovered we were in Vegas to celebrate husband's big three-oh, small plates of dessert samplers appeared at the table gratis.  Husband's had birthday wishes written in chocolate across the plate and a solitary candle.  Little details like this (and the posh, sophisticated interior dÌ©cor) make Craftsteak an overall fabulous dining experience.We ended up with a $1300 bill (tip included for party our size, tho) -- not that bad considering all we ate and drank, but to see a $1300 bill is so striking in its absurdity that someone actually snapped a pic of it and instantly uploaded it to Facebook...where it was met with all kinds of incredulity.  So no, it's not the kind of place you'd eat at on the regular (my honey has a $200+ Wagyu steak on his menu!).

Dinner for 4 came out to around $60 before tip and we got to try a nice variety of dishes.It was easy to see and taste the high grade fish they used right off the bat in the ""Seared Tuna Special"" which included crispy shallots, sweet onion, micro greens and chili oil combined with super fresh nigiri cuts of maguro.  This was a terrific mix of flavors.  $11!  That's about 50% off the strip price.  I almost wished I didn't have to share it.  I couldn't turn my back on the $3 (!!) Soho Tostadas and went with the tuna with Hawaiian poke sauce.  The tostada itself was made of taro and there were some delicious chunks of tuna on top mixed with cilantro and avocado cream.  Another great starter for sure.  The rock shrimp done tempura style was also nice portion for $7 and came with 3 unique sauces that I fail to remember the details of since my wife was seriously sweating the end of the Seahawks/Rams Monday night game due to some sports bets she had.  It was nice they had one TV up.Hydro Bibb Black Cod for $5 was a total freakin tease that ensured I'll get a full order of miso marinated black cod the next time.  Even the smaller portioned cod were cooked really well and the combo of cool lettuce, crispy wontons and fish was kind of like a deluxe protein taco.  Those all were excellent opening acts for what I was personally here for which was the short rib dish.  Ever since I saw that one picture of all those short ribs being grilled, I knew it was destiny!  It totally delivered.  The one rib was like something out the The Flintstones and tasted as good as it looked.  It was juicy and so tender that you could've just picked at it with chopsticks sans fork and knife.  The chef and owner of Soho, John Chien Lee, stopped by our table to ask how things were and gave us a breakdown on the business.  We were still open to one more dish so I asked him for a recommendation.  He asked what we liked and we said salmon.  He asked if we wanted something cooked or raw and we said raw.  He said he'd make something special for us off the menu (YES!) and 10 minutes later brought over this delectable dish with 8 pieces of scallop wrapped with salmon topped with a little green, lemon and some other stuff I can't remember.  John whipped up this dish thinking it would be a great finish to the meal after the heaviness of the short rib and MAN was he right.  Then he told us it was on the house!  Thanks, John!!  I suck for not taking photos of anything.  Las Vegas strip quality for locals!  Check it out."

I yelped the closest park to the Excalibur and chose this one because of the amount of green shown on the map. :)It was no more than a 15-20 min drive from the strip and I was totally blown away. I was unaware that this was a desert oasis, and that I'd see wildlife! There were so many trails, but we chose to just walk until we found water. We were greeted by the coolest ducks I've ever seen, who came out of the water and walked towards us curiously. We sat there for a while until we continued down the trail. We didn't stay there for too long as we had to drive back to California that evening, but it was the exact escape I was craving. They also have a visitor center with lots of great brochures, maps of trails, modern bathrooms (different from the park bathrooms) and they even show a movie about the wetlands all day long.If you need to get away from your get away, go here."

I was living in an are up north that had a sizable Southeast Asian community, and there were at least six Vietnamese restaurants within walking distance of my house. Not having a lot of spare cash coupled with the fact that the Vietnamese eateries were quite affordable meant that my friends and I would quite often find ourselves with bellies full of pho and vietnamese iced coffee. Fast forward many years later and I'm glad to find that there is an excellent choice for Vietnamese food a quick hop from my current abode.I've been to dine at Saigon Palace close to a dozen times and it has been consistently good. The staff has been friendly, the service great, and the food has been extremely tasting and satisfying. The Pho is quite good as is the Bun. Also, the quail appetizer is outstanding.

Didn't quite know what to expect from a Japanese-Italian fusion restaurant, but went for it!We got the prix fixe A meal.  Really, you can't go wrong with that.  I ordered the octopus carpaccio and the shrimp/mushroom spaghetti.  My husband ordered another octopus appetizer (I can't remember the name) and spaghetti carbonara.  The prix fixe also comes with a beer (PBR only) or glass of wine.Octopus Carpaccio: Sooo good.  Chewy, flavorful, with a spicy aioli type of sauce on top of it.  I liked it a lot.Other Octopus App: These were little WHOLE baby octopus fried calamari style.  It was kind of cool to see a whole octopus in that form, since I'm used to the little rings of calamari.  Those were fun to eat because I love me some tenticles, and they had tons of them!Shrimp/Mushroom Spaghetti: This is going to sound weird, but this dish tasted like Pasta Roni, which was fine by me because I love Pasta Roni, so I was very happy with this dish.  You could definitely taste the mushroom in the sauce, and it was a very generous helping also.Spaghetti Carbonara: I thought this particular dish was bland, but my husband enjoyed it.Overall, I liked the appetizers more than the entrees, but enjoyed my entire meal as a whole.  I would love to come back and try some of their other appetizers and get that octopus carpaccio again!  Nakamura-Ya is a very interesting restaurant concept well executed."

So, it evens out about the same price as other restaurants. Do try the salt and pepper tofu (and squid), it's my favorite. If fear factor is your passion, they serve innards too.

Stepping into the restaurant reveals an understated atmosphere and delightful quirkiness. For example, opening the front door occludes the MaÌ¨tre d' stand; even after four visits I was surprised by the affable voice of the host coming from behind me after the door closed! As you walk to your table, you will notice the cozy, warm interior that wraps around you like a blanket. Pleasantly dim light illuminates a main dining room with a low ceiling and exposed beams. A red accent wall with interesting art gives a splash of color to the earth tones of wine bottles and wooden slats from wine crates. black leather couches invite group conversations around an open bottle or three.If you choose an upstairs table, you will enjoy an even more intimate dining experience; a gas-lit fireplace provides the majority of the light in the room, and the boisterousness and cheer of the downstairs gives way to an atmosphere more conducive to hushed conversations and romantic whispers. Immediately you will notice the excellent (and constantly rotating) wine list. Of particular note is the multiple-tiered wine pricing structure. Anything from a taste to a full bottle is available, making it easy to adhere to a budget (or a compulsion towards sampling a panoply of vino!). Generous pours increase the value even more. I felt surprised and gratified to note one of the best dessert wine selections that I have encountered in a restaurant. Everything from Muscat to 30-year port makes an appearance in the comprehensive selection.But we're really here to talk about the food, aren't we? It does not disappoint. On this particular evening (2/23) I chose the four course tasting menu. When traveling for business, why not do it in style? The opening salvo from the kitchen consisted of Escargot with angel hair pasta, herbs, Parmesan cream, and a crispy slice of bread. Truly excellent. The Parmesan featured strongly in the flavors, unlike many cream sauces, which tend to emphasize too heavily their namesakes. The escargot were perfectly prepared. All in all, an excellent appetizer.For a second course, I was the lucky recipient of one of the best fish dishes I have had in recent memory. It was a lightly breaded flounder fillet with a scallion pesto cream sauce and sautÌ©ed  parsnips. Let me say that I relished every bite of this dish. Flounder is a fairly mild-flavored fish, making a blank canvas for the subtle sweetness of the parsnips and bite of the shallots. Number three was a red-and-golden beet salad with goat cheese, arugula, black truffle, radish, and an almost diaphanously light vinaigrette. You will not find a better salad this side of the French Laundry. Out of the four times I have been to toast, I had this salad three, and each time I welcomed it like a long lost relative. The mild pungency of the goat cheese and the earthiness of the truffle offset the sweetness of the beets to perfection, while the satisfying snap of the radishes and crunch of the arugula add vital texture. A perfect salad.Last but certainly not least the server put in front of me a seared flank steak with sautÌ©ed snow peas and fingerling potatoes, served along with an absolutely incredible onion cream sauce. Once again the interplay of textures resulted in a wonderful mouth feel; the creaminess of the potatoes, the chewiness of perfectly done flank steak, the satisfying snap of the peas, all bound together by the mortar of the onion sauce. It was absolutely heavenly.For dessert I enjoyed a glass of port along with the decedent luxury of their french toast with ice cream and apples. A perfect end to a wonderful meal.All in all Toast!'s attention to detail impressed me most. Their food is not fancy in a haute cuisine way; rather it stands on its own with the natural flavors of each of the ingredients doing the majority of the talking for the dish as a whole. Simple food done superbly. In addition the service is excellent without being officious or solicitous. Silverware is replaced between courses. Water glasses seem to mysteriously refill. The kitchen churns out new masterpieces  in response to food allergies or preferences. The spotless bathrooms eschew paper towels for neatly-rolled cloth (like the French Laundry). The list goes on.Despite my loyalty to Austin, TX, experiencing Toast! Made me long, just a little, for a change in lifestyle venue. People of Pittsburgh, let me live vicariously through you! Go early and often."

They have gloves there for you to use so don't worry about buying boxing gloves.  You will need to take a shower afterward and there are not showers at the gym, so plan accordingly.  Make sure you sign up online and reserve a spot in a class (which you can do on your smart phone).  You do not punch other people, just bags.  Do not be afraid to come by yourself, that is normal."

My dad got a little too excited, he was running around looking at more stuff then I was. First-time grandpa moment :) I didn't notice if the pricing is more, less, or about the same as babies r us.

While it wasn't so much a tour as more of a bus ride with conveniences, it gave us a great experience to / from and at the Grand Canyon at a reasonable price.Here's the full run down of our tour:We were picked up from our hotel, albeit 5 minutes late, in a brand spanking new tour bus.  The bus had reclining seats that were comfy and roomy.  Compared to some of the other tours I saw, Sweetours by far had the nicest, newest, cleanest looking buses.  After our bus completed all its pick ups, we stopped in the parking lot of a shopping complex to wait for other buses to arrive.  This part felt a little odd as most tours I've been on they usually pick you up then head straight off to your destination.  Once all the other buses arrived, they shuffled us around depending on which tour we were taking.  After we were settled on our actual bus, they gave a bagged breakfast that had a pastry, granola bar, banana and choice of apple juice or water.  (TIP:  If you're looking for coffee, like my mom and I were, you're out of luck so it's best to get some before the trip).After they hand out breakfast (which you eat on the bus), it's off to your tour destination.  Considering how early the pick up was (ours was 6:30AM), I appreciated that the driver kept it quiet for most of the drive up to Hoover Dam, allowing us all to sleep.  He did give some spiel about limiting the use of the bathroom on board the bus but it made total sense.  Do you really want all 60+ passengers to use that thing and have the stench linger?!  Plus, the bus makes more than enough pit stops that the bus bathroom is hardly needed.Our first stop was Hoover Dam, where you have 15 minutes to take pics, use the port-o-potties and check out the gift shop.  After that, it's the long trek up to Grand Canyon.  On the way, make an additional 15 minute stop at a bar / gift shop for another snack / bathroom break then one last stop along Route 66 to pick up our bag lunches.  The bagged lunches (which you again eat on the bus) include your pre-selected sandwich, chips and cookies.When you finally arrive at the Canyon, they give you about 2 1/2 hours to explore, which I found was ample time to take in the Canyon, hike and stop at the nearby gift shops.After the Canyon, you head back to Vegas with one last pit stop at a Subway / gas station.  This is the only pit stop before Vegas so make sure you pick up some food if you're hungry because by the time you arrive back in Vegas it'll be a pretty late dinner.  On the road back, the driver did play two movies to pass the time.Right before we got into Vegas, the driver does mention that tips are ""always accepted"" but it almost sounded like he said ""expected"", which I found a little tacky.  Our driver was overall a good guy though  that seemed to like his job and made the drive pleasant.  When we finally got to Vegas they had some of us off board onto another shuttle for drop off.  Again, this was a little odd but it made for a lot less stops.Major plus for having cold, bottled water available to us throughout the whole day.  Saves you a ton of money from having to constantly keep buying water."

This kind of confused me, while I appreciate the fact that the owner was trying to be proactive, we honestly had not thought anything of the almost 10 minutes that we waited. It was busy and we had a baby car seat with us, so we needed to find a place to fit both of us and the car seat.

Even when we lived in North Phoenix, we have always believed the hour drive to see Dr. Bracken was well worth it. He is honest, caring, and does an amazing job at taking his time to explain what is going on with your dog in layman's terms. I, as well as everyone I know who sees Dr. Bracken, can testify that he GENUINELY cares about every animal that walks through the door!  Our dog has had some very random medical problems throughout his life. Dr. Bracken has always taken time and care to make a medial treatment plan that is FAIR! I am writing this review because in addition to already loving our care at Arcadia Animal Clinic, Dr. Bracken and the family at the clinic helped us in a way that they will never know. My fiancÌ© and I were 3 weeks away from our Sedona wedding when our lab suddenly stopped peeing and refused food. Dr. Bracken stayed late in the office to talk us through the process of decisions we had to make at the emergency animal clinic. After $1,800 (ouch!) and no real diagnosis, AAC's office called us to see how he was doing after the hospital visit. The decision was made to bring him in for a few days to keep under AAC's care and observation. We were extremely nervous; first, for the uncertainty of the situation, and second, because Coltrane was going to be our ring bearer in the wedding and we didn't know if he was going to be healthy enough to come on the trip up North. We were also stinging from the hospital bill - the thought of him going in for more treatment with our wedding pending 2 weeks away was devastating. Dr. Bracken kept him longer than the anticipated 2 nights. Their staff was extremely kind and patient with us (I don't know how they deal so well with all of us crazed animal parents!) and after 7 days of overnight care with a catheter, 3 prescriptions, and a scheduled surgery, they called us and told us Cole could come home. When my fiancÌ© went to pay our bill, Dr. Bracken told us to enjoy our wedding and it was a gift from the Arcadia Animal Clinic. There are no words that can explain how special that moment was for us. In the midst of the most stressful and financially trying couple weeks of our lives, they showed us love. I will never be able to say enough about this act of kindness; it left us literally stunned. We will work our way to repay the staff of Arcadia Animal Clinic and will forever be thankful for that favor which meant the entire world to us. Thank you Dr. Bracken and your team for showing us that good people still exist in this world, and thank you for the extra special care of our most loved family member - Coltrane!!"

Everything I have tried here is delicious, and it's all WAAAY better than you'll get at any Mexican chain restaurant. Again, we're talking authentic Mexican food, not the commercialized crap that you get at the chains. I think the few bad reviews on here must be from people who don't know what real Mexican food should taste like. I have tried several of their burritos (the new Pollo Adobado burrito is my favorite), the chimichanga, enchiladas, rolled tacos, enchiladas, and I'm sure a few other things that I'm forgetting, and everything has been excellent. And their fresh homemade chips are very good too, and they have a variety of freshly made salsas at their salsa bar. The only thing I've had that I didn't like was the shrimp tacos, the shrimp didn't taste fresh and they were just weird overall. My favorite thing on the menu? It's a tie. My go-to meal when I'm starving is easily the #23 combo - 3 mini tacos with your choice of meat (pollo asado, ground beef, carne asada or carnitas), all loaded with fresh guacamole & pico de gallo, along with a side of refried beans, rice, and a soda - ALL FOR JUST $5! It's so much food I almost never finish it all. And my other favorite thing is the Pollo Adobado burrito - it is HUUUUGE and loaded with flavor, it's unbelievable. And when I'm just in the mood for a big mess of junk food I'll get the loaded fries (basically a nachos supreme type dish but with french fries instead of nachos....mmmmm....). Check it out, you won't be disappointed. And FYI you will probably need to wait about 10-15 minutes for your food since everything is made fresh, but it is well worth the wait. In fact, I think I'm going to head over there right now. :)"

There were a bunch a good looking flavors and I will be back to try them. There are a handful of Mac & Cheeses on the menu. I had the Bleu Cheese and it was really tasty, cheap, and plentiful. For the pizza I tried their Hottie. Serrano, jalapeno, house made sausage, with some fresh chiffonade basil on top that really brightened it up. The crust was delicious and not greasy which I always like. It held up well to the toppings and wasn't a limp mess.  I loved loved loved the sausage. Fennel seeds in sausage always score points with me.A lot of new artisan pizza places go for combinations that just seem like they watched to much Food Network when they were designing their pizzas. PPP got their toppings sorted out with their food truck and they serve up smart and delicious combinations. The chef clearly focused on flavor and did not tie the menu to traditional American or Italian pies. I thought it was ballsy to go for this type of pizza place so close to Pizzeria Bianco but I think their well thought out and executed menu is going to surprise people in the area. This isn't really a negative just an FYI...although the menu would leave you to believe there is a sports bar theme with lots of TV's for watching games...there are not.

Anyways, yesterday's daycare stay was the icing on this already fantastic cake!I have been taking my 8 month old pit puppy here for about 5 months, and my other two pits have stayed here as well! It has been very hard for me to find any boarding/daycare facility that is pit bull friendly. Most places will board them, but won't give them any extra play times. This is not the case at Doggie Suites. My other two dogs aren't consistently good with other dogs, but Shayna( the GM) makes sure they get plenty of walks, love, and play time together! With my younger one, I am trying to socialize him as much as possible. Doggie suites is THE only place that will allow him to do that, in a safe and fun environment! They don't care if he is a pit bill or that he isn't neutered yet, in fact Shayna encourages me to bring him as often as I can so that he will stay as dog friendly as he has been. It's very comforting to know that my babies are judged on their breed. Any dog that goes in there is judged solely on their present behavior, which is awesome! Now back to Saturday- when I Bring Turtle to daycare it's usually during the week, but this last Saturday I picked up an overtime shift at work and figured T would like to see his friends. When I picked him up from daycare, not only was he exhausted, he was cleaner than when I dropped him off!! Rebecca, one of the owners, decided to give him a bath for me! I had mentioned when I dropped him off that I was probably going to give him a bath later if I wasn't too tired from my Saturday shift. Doggie suites took it upon themselves to help me out and give him a bath for me, free! It's the little things that count and that was such a kind gesture! Plus- daycare is only $20 a day while most places charge over $30!As I write this, turtle is giving me ""take me to daycare"" stare.Thanks guys for everything!"

Anyway I went on a cold day so there was a line and I waited an hour half but it was worth it.My friend and I ordered the fresh dozen oysters and you get to watch them crack it open for you. Then comes the long wait for the good stuff, the seafood gumbo. I gotta say that this was one of my highlights of my trip (and I won $$$ gambling). I haven't tried much gumbo before but I gotta say that this was worth the hype. The sauce is great for the seafood and I know my gf will like this because she doesn't want her seafood tasting too much like ""seafood"". The sauce is a little spicy and they ask how spicy you want it from a scale of 1 to 10, I ordered mine a 4 yet it was still spicy so keep that in mind.Overall I'm impressed by how one dish makes this place popular. The seafood gumbo is now a ""must have"" whenever I'm in Vegas."

We came for the Seafood Dinner Buffet that they have on Friday and Saturday nights.  This is the best buffet in Vegas at the moment in my opinion.  The quality of the food is very high and the price is very reasonable ($18-20 depending if you have player's card).  They have all the ""expensive"" things that people look for at buffets:  Prime Rib, King Crab Legs, Cocktail Shrimp, Sushi including Sashimi (which I've never seen at any buffet), Raw Oysters, and of course the beer and wine station.   The decor and layout of the buffet is pretty nice, with plenty of space between tables.  The line to get in is extremely long which can be expected since this place just opened a couple of weeks ago, but honestly that probably will not change in the future for the Seafood buffet given the high quality of the food and relatively low price.  If you can go early or don't mind the lines, then the Seafood Dinner is the best buffet in town."

Yes, I know you're waiting for it... so the ""must-tries"" have got to be: pistachio, mango, paradise, caramel, raspberry... ok, most all of them were really good!

It's seats about 40 people, 20 people per car which is a lot of people in one ride. I love how you start off on one side of the track just and end up on the other. Luckily for me i had to be in a wheelchair so i got to ride twice to get back on the other side.The best part about this coaster is the length of it and the fact that it is the only coaster that gives you a sense of competitiveness. As you ascend up the first hill you get to look at the people in the other car and chant sarcastic insults like ""loser"" and ""your going down"" I smile the whole time i'm on the ride and the best part is when you turn the bend, the other car gets close enough that you can reach out and slap their hands. My sister road in the opposite car one time and we literally held hands for a few seconds before our cars went down hill. this is my favorite coaster for all the dips and turns it has which is soooo exciting. It 's a good all around ride for kids and older folks. Only downside is the seats are pre made  so if your too fat you can't ride. Although when i went this guy had to use a seatbelt adapter which still didn't fit. I have nothing against obese people I just don't like it when they try to do things skinny people can do and thus hold up the fun for the rest of us.

As a teen, it was a place to pick up something small here and there (cards, lamp, frames), and dream about what ""my house"" would look like.  In the early 20's, I was still just getting little things (posters, candles, linens) because I had no money, but I would have fantastic dreams about what I would do - one day.  Moving into the later 20's, this became my go-to place for creating upscale Christmas baskets. (My favorite was an Italian night basket with the pasta, pasta sauce, bread sticks, Italian cake, chocolates, a few bottles of wine and wine glasses - and something special like a CD or special espresso beans.  A classic given and appreciated SEVERAL times.) Now in my (sigh) 30's I've completely resigned myself to the idea that I will NEVER get anything but little things here.  And I'm totally ok with that.  Cost plus is my favorite place for Christmas.  I do stockings for my whole family and I can find things that work for everyone(Ornaments, Chocolate coins) and things that show I was really thinking of them (This year's had a theme - everyone got drinks but that ranged from Thai Chai to Japanese Saki).My new favorite thing about Cost Plus is their jewelry section.  It's made huge leaps forward in the last 5-6 years.  Almost all of it is very ""today"" with prices that look very yesteryear.  I found beautiful handmade beaded dangling earrings for $5.  An amazing matching necklace was $15.  These both could have gone for 2-3 times this amount and been absolutely worth the price.  Let's home they don't realize that any time soon....While agreeing with a previous post about the cost of the furniture, I'd say it's most likely worth the cost as those expensive pieces have always seemed quite solid.  But then again - I don't go for the furniture.

Whilst the quality of the actual meat element of the burger isn't that great, the alternative option of a chicken fillet is always a good bet.That's the good thing about this place - the degree of choice and number of different alternatives available. Although I can't stand fussy eaters, and nothing annoys me more than going out for food with one, if you eat here and end up with something you don't like then it's pretty much your own fault given that you built it from scratch.I usually get the low-carb option... call it stupid female logic but I feel a lot less guilty munching my way through a burger packed high with all sorts of yummy fried and gooey toppings when it's on a bed of fresh green salad rather than a bread roll.And it also means I can justify having one of their Peanut Butter & Banana milkshakes. Obviously.If you're looking for the one on the Royal Mile and are confused as to why you can't find it, they've recently closed that one. But they still have their branch in the West End."

I love this place. The prices are so low and each aisle is separated into different ethnicities (e.g. hispanic, middle eastern, filipino, thai, indian, korean, etc...). I've found that this system either makes it really difficult or really easy to find what you're looking for. For instance, if I need kimchi, I know exactly where to find it. But if I need tamarind paste or fish sauce, I have no idea where to look because these things could come from one of many asian cuisines.Yue Wah has a pretty decent produce section too. Sometimes they run out of things, and some produce items seem a bit old. The garlic almost always has green sprouts growing out of it, so I try to avoid those types of items. But I love coming here for bok choy, plantains, and thai basil. I also love their selection of drinks. If I'm ever craving something cold, they have bottles of jarritos and a cans of guava juice for like $0.69! Compare that to the $1.79 high fructose corn syrup coca-cola you buy at the gas station. I have yet to explore Yue Wah's frozen food selection, but it seems like they have a wide variety of fishes to choose from, as well as easy stuff like frozen samosas.... yum!My least favorite thing about Yue Wah is the mean old lady that ""greets"" you with a grim stare as you come in. She is NEVER friendly and I'm not even sure she speaks english... not that there's anything wrong with that, but at least smile. Her husband (at least I think he's her husband) is much more friendly and will show you where anything is and answer any questions.In response to one of the reviews below, they DO carry oriental dishes/cups/teapots/platters/etc. Even little soaps and chopsticks ^_^ALSO BEWARE, they have a $10 credit card minimum so come with cash if your purchase is small."

Upon arrival I realized it was just a punch of small dishes you could order in order to make your perfect meal; Wikipedia has it described as ""are a wide variety of appetizers, or snacks, in Spanish cuisine""  to make it even more simple let me describe it as delicious! Ok so the restaurant itself is a very popular hot spot and parking is tight in their lot. Cross your fingers you get a sport there as you may be in for a walk; inside is just as crowded with the wait staff having to fight through the standing room only bar to bring your food out (bad design in my opinion but allows you to see the delicious food before you order); my 2nd time there the bar was less crowded but was still packed.  The staff is very knowledgeable about their dishes and drinks and were helpful in making suggestions to compliment everything I ordered (I asked them to do this they weren't pushing specials) The food was top notch; even though they are small dishes they still have enough to share between two people.  My first trip had a party of 15 people and our total bill was around $170 (minus drinks) so everything is reasonably priced. On my 2nd trip my GF and I discovered they have a 2nd dining area in an adjacent store; not sure if that is why the bar wasn't crowded or if we just happened to miss a happy hour but there was virtually no difference between the two buildings and don't think you are being downgraded by being asked to walk next door to sit down;"

Euphoria couldn't come any quicker. My brother ordered a Concrete, a thick milkshake, with the Flavor of the Day mixed in with Bumbleberry. The both of us, not being fans of the overtly sweet, were in love upon first taste. The lemon mixed with the mysterious bumbleberry was perfect for the hot summer day we faced. The service was more than accomodating.

Which means go spicy or go home!Me and the wifey wanted to try this place out finally after driving by it so many times. The one time I actually stopped by to try them was when they went on vacation for almost 2 months. I guess everybody deserves some time off especially if you have your own restaurant. After looking over the menu I decided to go with the Chicken in Spicy Garlic Sauce. The wifey was not all that hungry so she went with the Spicy Tom Yum Soup. Now back to my very first statement. Our server asked us how spicy we wanted the soup. He said choose from 1 to 3. Now from what I remember skimming on some of the reviews, their spiciness is hotter than the norm. So when my wife wanted 3 I politely interrupted her and said to go for a 1. Im glad we did because after tasting the soup, (which was awesome btw) my lips were burning. Combine that with the Chicken in Garlic sauce, wow! That in itself was spicy. Im glad my dish came with a bowl of white steamed rice because if it didn't, I would literally have steam coming from my head!Now im assuming not all they have on their menu is burn a hole in your stomach spicy but once I was done with my meal, my clothes were all soggy with sweat, like I just came from the gym. Now if I can actually lose weight while eating here, then I am set! Who said multi tasking was hard?As for service, we got our order pretty quick. But then again there were only two other tables being served. So next time the real test is when they are packed. Which means more trips to try other awesome food on their menu!The only thing I thought that stuck out were the prices. We only ordered two items, but with tax and tip it was about 21 bucks. I think that's why lunch time is a hit here with the lunch specials.  Im kind of glad it was spicy because I probably would have ordered more food. Needless to say, we left satisfied."

My husband and I recently started swimming laps together, and the Heritage Park Aquatic Complex is where we get our swim on. At $2 a swim, it's a bargain.  And if you plan in swimming often you can purchase multi-swim punchcards which make it even cheaper ($20 for a 30 punch card, other options available). The facility just opened in 2010 so it's fairly new, and it was designed with energy conversation in mind. There are two indoor pools..  a larger one complete with diving boards, lanes for swimming and an area for kids to play. The second pool is considered the instructional and therapeutic pool. There are classes offered, both instructional and fitness. For lap swimmers, there are flippers and kickboards available to use, and there are also aquaweights for people that want to do some water aerobics.  The facility is used by water polo teams for both practice and events, and there have been swim meets held at the pool as well so from time to time it does get rather busy.  Swim lanes are often filled up on weekday afternoons, but most swimmers have no problem sharing a lane. Every so often you may have to deal with an unruly child that isn't being properly supervised by his or her parents, but the lifeguards try to keep the swim lanes free from horseplay.I own a pool, but I am still a big fan of the Heritage Park Aquatic Complex because it offers indoor swimming at a super affordable price!

Thanks to them I listen to Carbon Based Lifeforms on a normal basis), but my experience today was less than mediocre. Whenever I deal with Sarah, Josh, or Roxy, my experiences have been great. They get it right and if not, they don't make me feel like crud. Yesterday I ordered a regular soy Orange Sunset, iced but no ice, and Josh made it in a small cup filled to the rim. Today I ordered the same thing, and I make sure to be extremely clear about what I need, and whoever made my coffee today (young kid w/glasses whose name I'm unfamiliar with), seemed to not like that I asked him to take the ice out of my cup when he was done. Then he proceeded to teach me how I am supposed to order it (cold, no ice). Either way, I said NO ICE. He gave it to me in a cup that was bigger than the one I drank yesterday and also informed me he can't fill it all the way up unless I pay for extra milk. Then, I taste it and realize this is NOT soy milk. Luckily I don't have an allergy to cow's milk, so I waited by the bar to ask if it was soy to make sure. He was taking orders from other customers that were behind me at the time, already, and the girl next to me asked him for me since she was able to get his attention. He said no, it wasn't, and I politely asked him if I could please have it with soy as I cannot drink regular milk. He seemed very irritated with me, and I was really disappointed the situation was handled so poorly and I was made to feel as though him getting my order wrong was somehow MY fault. I don't like that feeling at all. This is the 2nd time this has happened with this particular barista. A simple ""I'm so sorry. Let me make you another one"" would have sufficed just fine. The coffee was great as usual the 2nd time around, and their Chocolate Chip Banana muffin is delicious too! Just make sure you are extra clear with certain people when you ordered. I should have asked a couple more times as follow up to be sure my order was made correctly, but I don't like assuming people don't get it right the first time... I assume though that they would ask me if they aren't sure."

My family (on both sides) has lived in NM for many generations. So I would like to think I know my NM food (I can cook it up and I was raised on it.) This place had been on my list for quite a while now. I am always in search of good NM cuisine, especially when I am not in the mood to cook it all up myself. I had stopped in one Sunday morning and was unwilling to wait for a seat. So I turned around. Vowing to try it again another day. Well folks Friday (2/11) was that day. Parking on the other side of the chinese restaurant, I walked towards the entrance hoping I could get in, as it was a Friday after 6pm. My timing was impeccable. There were 3 open seats at the bar, but I only needed one. The restaurant is dimly lit and the aroma of smoke from their grill lightly permeates the restaurant. Smelled faintly of my grandmothers kitchen, as she still uses a large wood cook stove to prepare most of her meals. Taking a seat at the bar, the stools wobbled and I feared my phat ass would end up on the floor so I tried not to move around too much as I begin my wait. Admittedly they were busy and the place is quaint and cozy (aka small). . A couple that walked in 10 min after me claimed the 2 seats next to me at the bar and waited with me for another 5+ minutes. WHAT?! The waiter/manager walked up and handed them menus...as he turned to leave and fetch them some water, I turned back politely and asked him for a menu and water also. (Feeling a bit invisible as I had been waiting for a bit and couldn't get anyone's attention.) The man sitting next to me passed me his menu as he knew what he was already going to order. Receiving my water and finally able to place an order for a beer, I continued to watch the guys at work in the kitchen as the flames and red coals from the wood fired grill lured me into a daydream that distracted me from making a decision on what to order. Luckily to took them awhile to take my order. I couldn't make up my mind they had a great menu and some wonderful looking specials on the chalkboard behind me. Finally, I decided on the Taos Combo they had on the specials board, which included 2 Schriners New Mexican sausages, 2 bacon wrapped grilled shrimp and 2 rolled blue corn green chile enchiladas stuffed with cheese and lightly smokey cubes of pork and rice and beans of course. Once ordered it came out relatively quickly. Very generous portions served on their famous metal platters. Everything was delicious and well seasoned (simple). The flavors imparted on the sausages and shrimp from the wood grill were delicious and the shrimp were perfectly tender. The blue corn tortillas were real blue corn, not white corn with blue dye like I experienced at another restaurant recently. So much food I took more than half home for leftovers later. So why 4 and not 5 stars....I was pretty much invisible to the staff for the first 15 minutes of my visit. They did get busier later but they are experienced at handling a crowd. I shouldn't have had to wait so long initially."

Reasonably priced especially during lunch hours (5.99 for a two item Calzone with a drink). Can't beat that.

They even have VIP rooms for private parties!! When we arrived at our room, we took a nap in the comfy king. The room was very nice and beautifully decorated. My favorite part was the flat screen TV above the garden tub in the bathroom! The steakhouse (I think it's called T-bones??) was very nice too!

Based on the reviews here and elsewhere on the internet, I decided to check out Winghart's. I am glad that I did because it was a very delicious burger.Wingharts is a pretty small place in Market Square, but it does have some outside seating which is helpful if you go at a popular time. The menu is small, basically just burgers and pizza. But since they do these so well they don't really need to add anything to the menu. I went with a burger with bacon and cheese on it and it was outstanding. Sometimes when you order a burger with bacon the bacon can overpower the burger, but not so here. The bacon was a perfect compliment to the very tasty patty.Only negative aspect of my experience is the waitress, while very nice, wasn't the most attentive waitress. But it wasn't bad enough that I would not come back or recommend it to others."

The combo of top notch service, delicious food and a fab atmosphere has made me an official fan of this place. I love that they send text messages to alert the customer when the table is ready!We started with an order of the shrimp ceviche to share. We were hungry, so the portion was perfect for two to share. All the traditional ceviche flavors made it into this dish, but the jicama was a delicious and crisp addition to the dish. Yum!My friend opted to order off of the Restaurant Week menu, which was 3 courses for $30.00, and of course I had to have a tasted of each item! Chris started off with the Caesar Salad, which was perfectly dressed. For this entree, he ordered the Short Ribs served with a side of delectable mashed potatoes and some sort of root vegetable. Did I mention the short ribs were topped with an egg? (I think it was over-easy). I've never had an egg with short ribs....and it was the best decision Chris ever made! Red Velvet cake came for dessert. The cream cheese frosting was nothing short of perfection. I ordered the grilled salmon for dinner. Some might say that was a boring choice, but I was in the mood for something simple. My choice certainly hit the spot! The salmon was grilled to perfection (medium rare), served with some fingerling potatoes and green beans. The green beans were a little to crunchy and a little charred for my taste, but still enjoyable.Our server Alyson, who was pleasant and on-point all night deserves a shout-out. Thanks Alyson!I will definitely return to Chelsea's Kitchen.Thanks Gabi M. for the suggestion!"

Drive there and find it is TINY! I want to say it's about 10 by 10 feet with a handful of bar type chairs by the window and a couple tables by the street. It's definitely not a restaurant. More of a food truck slash stand.If you haven't guessed, it's kind of ""ghetto"" being on LV BLVD across the Olympic Gardens Gentlemen's Club haha.We were the only ones there. I took it as a bad sign because the chef looked like he was in a bad mood and his up selling techniques made him seem a little unappreciative of having customers by his tone of voice.The menu is small, everything is under $5.00 being a sort of tamale you can only order to go. The Arepas are about $3-$4 depending on the meat or style and are definitely worth the price. They aren't HUGE so don't expect something with huge portions, but the flavor and specialness of the item is there. We ordered the #1 which was beef and added mozzarella for $0.50.I asked for it to go and the chef suggested we eat it there and we'd enjoy it more.It was DELICIOUS!An arepa is a masa ""patty"" that gets grilled on both sides so they're crispy, and filled with different meats, veggies, sauces , ect.The masa is crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and the fillings are so good!I described it as a cross between a tamale, a sopa, and a torta.There are different hot or cold fillings.They also have drinks, empanadas, and snacks.After having it I ordered some to go for my friend and they loved it as well.Overall love the place. Wish the Gentlemen working was nicer, but every one has those days. The food was great and that's all that matters.Btw, they serve with two sauces, a creamy green and a spicy/sour red and are both SO GOOD. They also give you sauce to go.Highly recommend!"

They offer so many add-ons for your party like a clown, face painter, and dancing. I didn't get any add-ons and I bought my own decorations. The day before the party I dropped off the decorations and they made me feel so relieved because they told me not to worry about anything, it will all be taken care of. Just show up 15 minutes before the party with the food and the cake and they will take care of the rest. And that's what they did.The parties are on Sunday and they are 2 hour blocks.

Here's what I sampled:Calamari: 2.5/5: I can tell the calamari is likely made in house, but the breading was too heavy for my liking and the sauce that accompanied the dish had little flavor. The portion is certainly generous, though. Rotisserie chicken: 4/5: Super juicy and flavorful. The way a rotisserie chicken should be! The two sauces that come with the chicken (green and yellow) are equally as tasty. Cilantro rice: 3/5: This was a fine side item, but I found myself spreading a bit of the green sauce on the rice to kick up the flavor. Plantains: 5/5: Perfectly fried, fresh and delightful. Huge hunks of lovely, slightly crispy plantains. Overall value: 4/5: For $6.50 ish you can get 1/4 white chicken plus two sides.

The kind of place which spend more time on the food than the decor (which still isn't bad).I used to work a few blocks from this place, and would visit once a week (at least).The pizzas and other displayed food looks good, but on my first visit I noticed that the two people in front of me ordered the same eggplant parmesan lasagna my interest was piqued. I was then served one of the best eggplant dishes I've ever had - it's basically a pile of eggplant with a delicious sauce in between the layers. They also put more sauce on top, and you can choose from meat or tomato - both are good.The pizza here is good thin-crust pizza. I haven't tried the calzones, but they look really good - my problem is I almost always get the eggplant.The coffe here is OK (it's Lavazza), and you can get a combo with a coffe for some dishes. I probably wouldn't go here just for the coffee (because I'm a coffee snob), but its good enough if you just need an espresso hit."

YOU'RE AN ELITE YELPER RIGHT?!""Ooo! I am indeed a Yelper and you're calling me out! I never took the time to drive myself out of the way to eat at a little cafe, but one day the opportunity came when I had to make a visit to the adult Disneyland, the DMV. Yelp said it was 1.2 miles way? HUH... LETS GO!I normally don't write reviews on first visits, but it was good... really good... seriously really good. I had the Tree of Life sandwich ($9.95) to go which is VEGAN, but a bite of that gyro sandwich MASTERPIECE had me considered a vegan lifestyle for a quick second. I don't know why its called Tree of Life, maybe because you feel completely transformed, like a born again virgin. The sandwich consisted of something like pickled onions, roasted red peppers, avocados, greens, tomatoes, and MAGIC. Sort of a tangent, but I took a bite of my TO GO sandwich in my car (bad habit) and was so amazed that I decided to eat the whole thing in my car, go back inside and grab a fork to finish the side salad, and was late for my class and quiz. Was it worth it? You bet. I am excited to come back and try the soup, salads, the BIZNESS, bars, pretty much everything. CHECK IN AND GET $1 OFF YOUR SANDWICH OR THE BIZNESS."

I hear it gets busy during the regular season so if you're planning on coming here on game days, I just went for a pre-season game and there was a pretty decent turnout.  The decor is regular bar decor.  Beer-inspired wall hangings, I believe a full bar, pool tables, and booth seating.  What's better than having a beer as LT looms over you?The food?  It's a dive bar with bar food; what's to expect?  It's the perfect food for a game, maybe not the perfect food for a first date.  Now if you've been together for years and don't care what gets on your face or what comes out of your butt later that night... it's perfect!The only con I can think of is the smoking...

We had spent the whole afternoon hiking, and were ready to settle down for some pizza - and they had the highest Yelp ratings. Other than the wait, this was a great experience. And we knew there'd be a wait - we're from the city, it was Saturday night, and it was Spring Training in downtown Scottsdale... we knew what we were in for.When we were seated, our waitress took great care of us. She got us a ton of water, talked about how they do pizza there, and was quick and attentive. We made a pretty quick decision on a basic salad and a nice pizza, and I don't know if it was hunger or really just delicious pizza, but we managed to kill that food in no time.Overall, the pizza is thin and crispy, just how I like it. You have to build your own, which can get kind of expensive, but it was definitely worth it. We had a great view of the open kitchen, and we knew when our pizza was being made. It was a bit loud, due to the crowd, but it felt alive. Sometimes, the noise is overwhelming; here, it just seemed right.We'll likely stop at Grimaldi's every time we visit Scottsdale in the future.

I also liked the little TV they had inside of the bathroom mirror.The downfall was that the walk to the strip or casino was just too far of a walk from the hotel.  In warm weather, I guess it wouldn't be an issue but it was raining and freezing cold.  Even thought Wynn was just down the street, you know Las Vegas had long blocks and we suffered.

Windsor and Postino are two of my favorite restaurants, so I was extremely excited to try their new venture - Federal Pizza.Our waiter was fantastic, recommending selections from each section of the menu. Because it was a work lunch, we didn't sample one of their wine coolers that consist of a house made infusion and sparkling wine, but I WILL be back for happy hour one day to try them out.The atmosphere is really great - the windows fill the whole place with light and mid-century modern decor is abound. One of the small details I loved is that each table has a different style of salt & pepper shakers, so it was fun to look around and see the fun varieties. Being an Upward Project, the restaurant features cozy & comfy seating as well as a fantastic bar set-up and patio.For starters we got the corn coins (marinated/cheese covered corn cobs sliced into coins) and they were delicious. Sweet & salty. We also got the baratta and bread and it was also tasty. If I had to chose one, I would get the corn coins since they are not something you see on other menus in town.We decided to skip salad this trip and split two pizzas - the Casanova (featuring dates, prosciutto and arugula) and the Manifesto (featuring Shriner's sausage, mushrooms, onions and cheese). Both were incredible, and how could they not be on the doughy yet crunchy Michael Coe crust. It's my favorite crust in town now, so look out Parlor! I already am excited about my next trip there. If you love Windsor and Postino, run, don't walk, to Federal Pizza. You won't be sorry!"

The consensus favorite dish might have been the Butterfish.  However, I substituted the Ahi for the Salmon in the Trio, and I will say that I'm not sure I could pick between the Mahi Mahi, Ahi, and Butterfish...they were all excellent.Service:  Our waiter (Melvin I believe) was great.  Upbeat, enthusiastic, clear, and very knowledgable and accommodating.  Furthermore, their Birthday service exceeded expectations.  Each menu featured a special page with my wife's name on it.  They later presented her with a copy to take hope tied with a bow.  Later in the meal they took a family photo with their camera as well as several camera phones.  They brought a printed and framed version to take home shortly after.  Lastly, they brought out a special birthday dessert with my wife's name and ""Happy Birthday"" written on the plate (chocolate sauce I believe).All in all I felt like Roy's offers tremendous value.

Going on my best of Tempe list.  If you are one of my anonymous followers on Yelp, you know I love meat.  When we make plans to eat at Green, I get excited because the food is great despite the fact that there is no meat.  They just make great food at Green.I usually get one of fruit-flavored sodas that come in the glass bottles from the refrigerators next to where your order your food.  Never had one that tasted good, but it is fun trying them all.  Maybe one day I'll start worrying about my sugar intake.  And the tSoynami's are really good, but closer to a dessert than a drink.The wings were suggested to me on my first visit, which seemed a bit daring for a vegan restaurant, but . . . they were great and I get them all the time.  I would not recommend a vegan pizza unless you know what you are getting yourself into.  My mostly vegetarian daughter lives off of cheese and mushroom pizza, but couldn't stomach the vegan verity.  Now she has the crab puffs and peanut tofu appetizers.  And my vegetarian wife gets whatever she wants and doesn't have to ask about unmentioned ingredients, which I have been told is a rare and liberating experience.The layout of the interior provides a friendly and inviting atmosphere.  We usually try to snag the couches.  Art from aspiring artist usually decorate the walls, and the bathrooms offer really cool sinks.  Opposite the wall of art is a mural made up of re-used and re-claimed materials.  I like it and my daughter always has a few questions about it (e.g., Are those car doors real?  What is that?), which gives me a chance to point out that re-using is even better than recycling, although both have merit.  A few more visits to Green, and I'm sure my daughter will know what I'm talking about.And our Tempe location, the original location, is better than your Phoenix location.  There, I said it.

We stopped by for a late lunch on a weekend with our party of four.* Crispy Deep Fried Bean Curd with Three Ingredients ($9.95) - The three ingredients being shrimp, fish, and scallops.  There were only a few scallops though because I didn't get any.  But the real treat was hot they fried up the tofu.  It was so good.  There's only been one or two other places (in SF) that fry it up that way and it's  yum with a delicate outside crust.* Ox-Tail with Red Wine ($12.95) - It looked more like pig's feet (which I love anyway) and the best part was the fermented beancurd spread they serve with it.  (I've only seen it in cubes, in a jar, so having it as a spread was just yummy goodness!)* Beef and Bitter Melon Chow Fun (Wet style) - I'm not a fan of the bitter melon, but my aunts were and they chowed on it.  It was a hearty portion and the chow fun noodles were good enough to eat the next day (without the bitter melon taste on it).* Lamb Clay Pot ($16.95) - This dish looked more like oxtail stew than lamb, but supposedly it was.  There were also carrots too in it.  It was good, but not my favorite of the dishes.Those four orders were more than enough for four people, we had plenty of leftovers for sure! Service was standard, water and tea arrived promptly and we had to wave to get refills.  But overall, everything was fine.  My aunts said the food tasted pretty authentic in their opinion, and it was decent for the most part.3.5 starsOn another note, when you do walk in, you do see the fish tanks with their live seafood available for sale.  The tanks looked pretty clean to me!  I didn't really notice it until our way out though."

So with the location programmed in my head, I drove to Zaytoon after my PT appointment for my late lunch.The market is larger than I expected for an ethnic market located near Desert Breeze Park.  There are plenty of parking spaces in the strip mall where it is located, so buy as much as you want, because the walk to the car will be a short one.  The market has a decent size herbs & spices section, including Sumac, which I have recently heard about in my Mediterranean Cuisine class. They also carry fresh herbs in the refrigerator and they are in good condition and priced reasonably.  But I was mainly here to try the kabob and the Mashti Malone ice cream, which I didn't find on my own and had to ask about with the owner/cashier.Anyway, my primary objective is to try their kabob and I ordered their Koobideh Kabob entree ($8.99), which is Persian marinated ground beef, grilled on a sword-like skewer, and served with grilled tomato and Basmati (long grain) rice, and some raw onions.  The portion was good, and the Koobideh was juicy and pretty tasty. I would give it a 4 stars on the food. And 5 stars if they also serve fresh bread (like the one at Flame Kabob) too.Service was good, but I was also the only in the ""restaurant"" at around 3:20pm, and the older gentleman and later the son(?) both came out on separate occasion to ask how the food was and if everything was okay, plus give me suggestion about the traditional way of eating the Basmati rice (which is to mix it with some of the soften butter and sprinkle with some Sumac).  So 4.5 stars there.I also asked about and was directed to their freezer right by the cashier and the door, where they keep all the Mashti Malone Persian Ice Creams.  I tried the Rosewater Saffron with Pistachios Ice Cream Sandwich last night, and wanted to try a different flavor today and went with the Creamy Rosewater Ice Cream ($2.99 for the smallest size container or 4 fl oz) so I can have it at the store.  I love the taste and fragrance of the rosewater, which is so different from the other more traditional ice cream flavors available everywhere else.They also serve fresh squeezed juice at the juice bar, but I didn't see a menu for that.  Their ad states that they serve fresh juice (juiced per order) and have no additives, no added sugar and made from fresh not frozen ingredients.  Which makes this a hidden gem for juice lovers.With Zaytoon being in my neighborhood, I will definitely be back for more ice cream, kabobs and sample their Juice Bar offerings.P.S.  They also offer cater services and will deliver within a limited delivery area for a 10% delivery charge and on minimum order of $50."

Everything is a ""suite.""  The standard suite is better than lots of upgraded rooms at other hotels on the strip.  It is either a 1 or 2-bedroom suite with a sunken living room.  There is also a small dining table and office area in the room near the window.  The office area consists of a printer and wired hub for your internet needs.  The bathroom is extremely spacious with 2 sinks, a tub, and a shower in each room.  The actual ""toilet room"" is connected to the bathroom, but for some odd reason, does NOT have a lock on it.  Not good if you have those practical jokers staying with you.* Check in is a breeze.  They seem to have enough attendants at any given time, including a few at the ""Invited Guest"" check-In.* Player's Club (Grazie) has decent benefits and sends you free rooms from time to time.* 3 TVs in each room* Mini bar in each room.  Might be in a cabinet, so look around.  * Upgrades are not that expensive and the rooms are a lot nicer.* Need your room key/card to get to the elevators to the room.  This is both good and bad because some people I go with are staying at other hotels and I don't want to have to go down to get them if I want them to come up to the room.  However, I do like the added security.* $20 upgrade trick works here.  But, maybe not all the time and to varying degrees.  For instance, you might only get a same size room, but with a Strip view.* Temptation is also in your room.  And no, I'm not talking about those brochures they hand out on the street.  I'm talking about the snacks that are put on scales, so when you pick it up, you bought it!  I am always tempted to pick it up to look at it.  I have no idea why.  It's not like I can't get cashews in the Bay Area!As far as food, they have a mini-food court in which some of the places stay open 24 hours.  There are also a bunch of high-end restaurants in the walkway between Venetian and Palazzo not to mention a Grand Lux CafÌ© (they have a small breakfast buffet in the morning here).  They also have a Bouchon Bakery under the escalators and near the room elevators.  Delicious pastries here!The casino is fairly big and has enough variety.  My favorite slot is the Wheel of Fortune machine and they have a few of them of different denominations all over.  There are tons of tables, but I'm still waiting for an Uno table.  I mean, if places can have war, why not Uno?!?"

I mean, everything with truffle has to be good, right? But these were exceptional! Seasoned with just the right amount of spices, chives, parmesan flakes, truffle oil, and (surprise!) gravy! Suuuuuper good! Oh and with a sundried tomato aoli dip. Mmm mm mmmm!Ok burgers. I got the Miyagi-San burger. I was nearly crying (and definitely licking my fingers...hell my whole hand) from the pure insanely good quality and tastes in my mouth. Beef medium, thinly fried onion rings, and an over-easy (not drippy!) egg. Buns were toasted, soft, sweet and yet so perfectly matched with the burger contents. Amazing, I was actually really sad when I finished eating.They need to bring this place to LA, they will make millions!

This arrives to your table wrapped in tinfoil and set on fire. The waiter or waitress unwraps the tinfoil, setting the fire out. The small fire adds a hint of a smokiness, like a light barbecue.

The top  floor holds the temporary exhibits, so it's nice to start there and work your way down. When I was there a couple months ago they had some massive wood sculptures carved from tree trunks and one big installation which was basically a big hole that overlooked the neighbor's backyard. Very interesting. My absolute favorite thing is the light exhibits on the 2nd floor. Take your beau and grab on. It's terrifying and fun at the same time.

That's what I did today, and I'm glad I did - at least so far! At first glance, Chino Bandido looks like a pretty pedestrian Mexican restaurant, just another divey, strip-mall eatery among countless others spread across the Phoenix landscape. But they are decidedly unique. Instead of stuffing their burritos with carne asada or refried beans or shredded chicken, they fill their tortillas with the likes of Chinese BBQ pork, Jamaican jerk chicken and Egg Foo Yoo. What!!? All of there offerings are served either as rice bowls, quesadillas, or burritos. Turn your order into a combo and you get beans (black or refried) and rice (cooked one of 4 different ways).I opted for the two burrito combo with jerk chicken and chinese pork. Now, I've been here before and sometimes the burritos are on the small side. Not so today. I'm not sure if it's because I ordered in the late afternoon instead of in the middle of their lunch rush, but these burritos were huge! The chinese pork was just the right combination of sweet and savory. The jerk chicken was packed with flavor and had a nice mellow burn to it. The combo was served with black beans (decent) and jerk fried rice (amazing). Oh, and instead of a fortune cookie, you get a snickerdoodle. Not my thing, but pretty delicious. All this for around $9!!Now, here are a couple of things to note:1. Yes, the place is pretty dumpy. It's located in a rough-looking strip mall. It was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and this definitely fell in the ""Dives"" category. The dining room is pretty non-descript - a bunch of plastic folding tables crammed into two rooms. 2. Surprisingly, the restrooms are really nice - clean and modern. They must've just remodeled them (at least the men's room), because it's the nicest part of the restaurant. How often can you say that?3. Ok, so I have a degree in engineering but I feel pretty stupid every time I order here. They have these forms that you're supposed to fill out that are less than intuitive. I'm sure if I were a regular, I would get the hang of it. The good news is that they have a friendly staff eager to help.All in all, it's a fun and unique dining experience. Oh, and they have an awesome panda statue in the dining room. Seriously, it's awesome.I'll be back...."

I think I pay more in taxes than I actually net on the small amount of additional income it gets me, so I'd hope any bias I have is well-tempered.As someone whose been to almost all the county's Ys, I'm a big fan of the C-K.  Tucked into the Wachovia (now Wells Fargo???) One building, and adjacent to the Hilton, this beacon of sweat calls to the uptown corporate crowd and those in town for just a few nights.  Hint: almost all the traveling shows for the performing arts center give their crew and cast passes to come and use this Y.  I've met dancers, singers, and performers of most of the bigger shows here.  Humorist David Sedaris (and his sister), for example, were in town recently for a one night performance- they both came to swim and had a great time (he even mentioned the visit during the show!).So why this Y?  3 main reasons.  First, this place is not so gargantuan that you would get lost making your way from the lockers to the gym floor.  This also means the crowds are manageable and people tend to know the other people around.  I don't find this so much at the Dowd, for example.  The friendly aires here are just a little more appealing both for motivational and enjoyment of the visit purposes.  Second, the cardio and weight equipment is well-maintained and logically laid out.  They just put in new free weights and redesigned that part of the gym with some new machines to boot- which was a nice upgrade.  People here generally care enough to wipe down the machines after they are done and don't mind letting you work in for sets.  When you are on a schedule, this helps.Third, everything you want is here in one place.  Group Ex classes, a pool, an indoor track, personal training and basketball half court.  If you get hungry, check out the food bar at the entrance- it's get a nice selection of food options that aren't fried or wrapped in cheese and bread.  I also find at least the men's locker room to be amply sized, with plenty of shower stalls, a steam room, a sauna, and plenty of lockers for day use.  Lunchtime tends to be busiest, but the early morning crowd gets decently sized too.  The after work rush is much more subdued lately, no real idea why.  If you want the place almost to yourself, come in between 8:30 am - 11:00 am or 2:30 pm - 5:00 pm.  Amazing how things empty out then.  One note of clarification- parking is free for up to 2.5 hours in the Wachovia/Hilton deck so long as your are out before 8:30 am or enter after 4:30 pm.  The times do not apply on the weekends, though I am sure the gym here is closed completely on Sundays.  Whatever you do, just make sure you stamp your parking ticket with the Y stamp at the entrance.  The parking deck attendants have little mercy for those who do not follow the restrictions.  Comprende?I'm a morning person and the best part of this gym, for me, is the community of regulars who also make the daily pilgrimage to burn some calories before the sun rises.  There are some serious athletes who train like crazy and some desk jockeys who live for their exercise highs outside of the office (that's my hand raised in the back of the room).  In all, it is a great mix of people who will open up if you take the time to talk to them.  Join one of the early morning running groups or become one of the die-hards looking for some self-inflicted punishment in one of the boot-camp style fitness classes- whatever your flavor of exercise, you can find it here and all in one nice, compact easy to access place."

The feast that followed was one for the ages..We chose this place because the high rating, the deliciously fresh looking pictures and the proximity to mgm signature and the strip. This exceeded any sort of expectations we had that night. We had no idea this was an AYCE joint and had i known, i may have put up a small fight as to going here, but I'm glad I didn't because right when we sat down (at the bar of course) the very personable sushi chefs threw the AYCE idea at us and we didn't know if we could really eat our money's worth. But Sushi Goyemon has you covered! You don't have to order the AYCE (which is basically the whole menu including the specials) but if you happen to order more than the cost of the AYCE, they automatically make it AYCE and you can eat and eat and eat and eat! And eat we did..My girlfriend is still pretty new to all this raw fish stuff, and she enjoyed this experience every bit as much as I did. I told her, ""Don't worry, if it's fresh, you'll love it!"" and love it she did!! every single piece, all 5'4'' hundred pounds of her wolfed down that sushi like she was Oprah at thanksgiving!If I even began to go down the list of delicious morsels we had that night this would end up a dissertation; but I will say that that all of the fish was really fresh, the service was awesome and we're here a week after that meal still thinking and talking about our experience.P.S.

Inside, the atmosphere is pretty sparse but the friendliness of the people, the incredible prices (see the menu pics I posted), and the delicious food more than make up for it. I tried the carne asada, al pastor, tripa - I ordered it extra crunchy - and lengua ... all superb!

The room and massage table was cozy and the masseurs gave us enough space and time to be able to de-robe and get comfortable.

We'll extend it for you...:) Woo hoo! We were thrilled because we wanted to try happy hour out first! Started with the tuna tostada, amazing! Sweet and fresh and the perfect way to start our meal! Also a very delicate & modern presentation. Next came the stuffed mushrooms, not a fan at all. The flavors were ok but the breading was dense and the bites were heavy. I didn't enjoy it.Next came the Cajun albacore sashimi. My favorite dish of the evening. So fresh and delicate and very mild in flavor. Like butter...Next the cod, my second favorite item. It was cooked perfectly, sweet & tender. Next the firecracker roll. Great combinations of flavors with sweet onions on top and over all a very well balanced roll. Crunchy, creamy, sweet & spicy.Next the Ika Geso, octopus! It was tossed an a very addicting curry powder! And lastly a spicy tuna roll, filled with tuna! And a shrimp tempura roll.

My server was SPOT on, and I have a great history serving tables. He clearly understands the value of, ""Silent Service"". Attentive when needed, non intrusive and very helpful. My advise, ask for Robert (gentleman with salt and pepper hair), his demeanor and attitude were a delight.Appetizer: 5/5: The calamari was AMAZING. Crisp, light, not over or undercooked, with a delicious dipping sauce. PERFECT!Management: a truly nice addition, i had just finished my appetizer and the manager took my plate and ensured i enjoyed it. Great attitude.Dinner: 4.75/5: i had the 8oz. Filet (mid-rare) and perfectly cooked, accompanied by the mac n' cheese. First off the steak was MAGNIFIQUE! However, 2 things...A. The mac n' cheese needs some help, slightly bland, and in need of more seasoning. Sorry Brand, but for my money, the mac 'n cheese at Galagher's in NYNY is superior. B. Albeit a small grievance, regarding the two sauces (which were DELICIOUS, by the way), perhaps a better method of delivery is in need. They come in 2 small creamer pourers, which can make for keeping them separate on your plate a small challenge. Perhaps two small accompanying saucers (as recieved for soy sauce with sushi).Aside from that, dinner was excellent. I left filled and delighted i stopped in. I will definetly bring back friends and co-workers for a nice dinner.Excellent work Brand!"

To be fair, I've been going to her since 2002 and I always scheduled my appointments for weekends I was going to be in Winston anyways to visit my family. Better still is that since I've been her customer for so long, she still charges me the same rate I paid when I started going to her way back when- $55 for a cut and color! After a couple of great (read: expensive) experiences and a couple of really bad experiences around Charlotte, I had come to accept that I was just going to have to be one of those people who traveled to get their hair done...Then I found Corey! After some asking around amongst my friends with good hair, TWO (who don't even know each other) referred me to Corey. After hearing all the great things my friends had to say about him, I figured I may as well give him a try. After some phone tag trying to set up an appointment, he was able to work me in later that week. Since I was going to someone new, I brought lots of pictures and ideas. After looking through them and asking me some questions, he told me his game plan and I was ready to go. Then I revealed to him my long-time dream of being a red-head but that I had been told before that my skin tone wouldn't work well with the shade of red I wanted. After showing him pictures of the red I liked, he said we could alter it slightly to make it ""mine"" and said, ""my theory is: if your hair looks good enough, the last thing anyone will care about is how well it matches your skin tone."" With those words of encouragement and the level of comfort I strangely already felt with him, I told him to go for it and just do whatever he thought would look best. Throughout the process, he kept me filled in on what he wanted to do next to make sure it was what I wanted. Man, was I impressed with the finished product! I was offered a beverage immediately (and he kept my glass filled throughout the appointment), his salon is very laid back- he's the only one in there and it has somewhat of a toned-down tattoo parlor decor, his prices are reasonable, and Corey is cool as hell. I am absolutely in love with my hair (and Corey) and am happy to say I have now found my new local salon and no longer have to be one of those people who travel to get their hair done!"

My normally one-hour meeting lasted two and a half hours, past my normal lunch time, so I was looking for food - fast.  Jimmy John's, as it turns out, does not deliver to our office building, but Google told me about Capriotti's.  After reading some other Yelp reviews, I opted to order online, but pick up in store.  I ordered my favorite sandwich (anywhere) - an Italian sub.  Ordering online was easy; I had the option to customize my sandwich and pay online or pay in-store.  My sandwich was ready and warm when I arrived (a few minutes after the ""ready by"" time), there was no line, and I was in and out in no time (around 1:00 p.m. on a weekday).  Now, the sandwich.  It was savory, flavorful, and, in short, absofreakin delicious.  It smelled wonderful, and I had to take at least one taste before returning to the office to finish devouring it.  I exclaimed with glee after the first bite, and was glad that I got the foot long.  It reminded me of an amped up Potbelly sub - but with thicker, tastier cuts of meat, and softer (yet less flaky and messy) bread.  $9 for a foot long of that caliber sandwich is a steal in my mind.  Jimmy John's, Potbelly, and Subway are a thing of the past now. :-)To address some of the other themes in reviews:  1. Accuracy:  100%.  I asked for no grilled onions, no pepper, and to add mayo.  2. Friendliness:  I was only picking up (and came in the back door), so there wasn't a party when I arrived, but the cashier smiled and was friendly enough.3. Timeliness:  My order was ready when I arrived, and I was in and out of the establishment within 2 minutes tops."

I've never written a review about them before, but I thought it was time. Everything about the meal was exceptional from the service, ambiance to the food. We had the Dungeness crab cocktail and shrimp cocktail which were both super fresh. Then the steaks and king crab legs along with scalloped potatoes and sugar snap beans. I forgot to mention the excellent vodka martini's. Our server brought us two different vodkas that we had never tried and they were both excellent.  I might just switch from Belvedere!There are many choices for a great meal in Scottsdale, but Mastro's City Hall is at the top of the list."

Probably the greatest bookstore in Metro Phoenix, hands down.  The prices are better than Borders (now out of business) and Barnes & Noble.  The atmosphere is fantastic.  Everyone who works here actually wants to help you out.  It isn't like the chain bookstores, where clerks grumble when you ask them for directions.  These people want to make sure you find what you are looking for, and they will pretty much do whatever it takes to make that happen.With an added bonus, Changing Hands is connected directly to one of my favorite restaurants, Wildflower Bread Company.  There's nothing better than buying a great new book, followed by a fresh cup of coffee in Wildflower's colorful atmosphere.All in all, I find this bookstore to be top-notch.  Remember, if you have some used books that you would like to trade in, then do it here.  You will get some Credit that you can spend on other merchandise in the store... It's the circle of book-life.  :)"

I've tasted: - French onion soup - good, solid choice, but not the best I've ever had.- Crab cakes - to die for!  They were really juicy and plump with not much breading.- Caesar - first time was delicious, second time was over-dressed - Artichoke salad - impressive presentation in an artichoke heart, but unfortunately, the leaves were not tender enough to eat.- Brocoli florets with hollandaise - incredible!- Charred sweet corn - Also surprisingly incredible.  It was so soft and sweet.  YUM.I had wine the first time I went and it was good and reasonably priced.

Like anything else in Vegas, it is a bit expensive, but once you get past that, you will have more fun than you ever thought. I took my three sons and we all shot the World War II package. We fired a Thompson sub machine gun, a Grease Gun, Stun, 1911, and an MP3. All fully auto. Nothing better than holding onto a fully auto rifle and feeling that rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat power in your hands.

And it makes for a quick walk from a lot of hotels.For a solo meal at the bar, this was a pleasant place. Long list of spirits, with a mix of the generic and considerably better options. The Eleven burger is a truly excessive concoction of burger, braised veal, bacon, onions, goat cheese, and a bun that managed to hold all that together without overwhelming the thing with starch. Awesome.I'd like to come back for a real meal, but why do that when there's the option of having a scotch and burger at the bar?"

First, I would like to thank SRP for the monster power surge that set fire to the electrical board in my dryer.  They shall be receiving my gratitude in the form of a claim for $300.Naturally, I discovered the problem on a Friday afternoon.  My first call to another highly rated appliance repair business resulted in an answer of ""I can probably get to it Monday or Tuesday.  Text me your information.""  Apparently, he was too busy to collect my information or actually give me an appointment.  Not to mention it would take me 27 minutes to text my address & phone on my flip phone as well as a refresher course on how to type a number.  Forget it.So I called Appliance Works.  They actually tried to work me in the same afternoon, but when the repairman got tied up on another call, they promptly called to let me know he would have to come the next day, a Saturday.  And he did come in the window I was given.  Although I assumed it was the board, he stated it was only a blown fuse and would be a mere $130 to repair.  Unfortunately, he had to leave for over an hour to get the fuse.  After he came back, he realized it was the board and would really be $270.  He forgot that a Frigidaire had to be tested differently.  I could forgive that since he was relatively young.  The kicker was that the part would not be in until the following Friday.  I expressed I could not wait that long and was considering just buying a new set.  It was only after we asked if there was any way to get the part sooner that he offered to have it expressed.  It was to get here on Tuesday.Tuesday came and went, and I did not hear from Appliance Works, so I called on Wed morning.  The gal I spoke with contacted the technician and through some miscommunication advised me the tech did not know if the part was in.  I wasn't happy about paying an extra $30 for rush unnecessarily.  She had the tech call me himself and he clarified the part had come in on Tuesday, but not until late.  He was going to confirm the right part had been ordered before calling.  He did follow up and came that evening to fix it.  Again, he was on time and the repair was made at the quoted price.  He also gave me a detailed receipt so that I can file a claim.Although there were a few snags, Appliance Works was very accommodating in scheduling me promptly.  I would definitely use their service again."

Mmmmm, truffle! After we ate that, our waiter asked us how we liked that and proceeded to put the Golden Ocean Trout on our table. There are POP ROCKS on that bad boy! If the ponzu alone didn't add to the oishii (deliciousness) of the dish; the pop rocks added that uniqueness to it! Very odd hearing it pop as u picked it up lol =) fun to say the very least!

I felt like Winnie the Poo when I saw all the honey they had especially the honey comb for sale which I love. I settled for a jar of honey though which turned out to be a mix of glucose and honey which I was not to happy about. I suppose I should have read the label but still honey shouldnt be ruined like that......but I loved the jar.

Sure...White Castle is great and you need something to flush out the evil the next day...but if you aren't looking for some weird burger cleansing ritual than this is the place to go. The meat is never frozen. The fries are cut fresh all day. The burgers are cooked to order. It takes a little longer, and you will not get in and out very quickly...but class like this isn't done quickly.I admire In-N-Out because they refuse to compromise their style and you can taste it in every bite.

The entrees are huge portions with as much white rice as you can eat. Twice Cooked Crispy Pork=amazing. General Tso's Chicken=awesome. Complimentary Egg drop soup=hearty.

I went with 3 other people, let's just say we're all very critical and precise when it comes to food.The wait, was..okay the wait was friggin' forever. Prolly 40 minutes or so. HEY I'M NOT A PANSY, I WAS REALLY IMPATIENT AT THE MOMENT OKAY??! Anyways.. they finally called us over..me and my stupid self galloped over to the table gazing at the beautiful bald chocolate man's animated face..I..I mean the menu. Uhh just to confirm when you go there..make sure to order something involving CHOCOLATE. Oh god, most of the people that were surrounding us ordered sandwiches..I mean REALLY?! Sup with that?! We ordered the Classic European Chocolate Fondue, which is enough for two, but we've never tried it, nor know the portion size, so we decided to just order one. I'm not going to create a huge hype for the fondue, since they only served huge sticky mouth watering marshmellows, fresh strawberries and bananas..with thick, sweet, sugary, plentiful white chocolate, milk/dark chocolate..sounds aight? Well it SURE AS HELL WAS! The whole setting was enjoying for us, definitely comin' back for some fondue swag. For the drinks, we ordered a couple o' Mexican Spicy Hot chocolates, and Melting Marshmellow Hot Chocolates. Overall, they were okay. Sweet, and chocolaty, basically. When it comes to the way the place looks, it is pretty relaxing. Nice lighting, ambiance, waiters, smell..oh the smell. Honestly, you will have a nice time, even if the food wouldn't be as good as you thought. Even the bathrooms are stunning. Wow, I'm such a loser.

When a fellow Yelper became indecisive during the ordering process, I suggested we go halves on the Bobbie and Capastrami. All I gotta say is, best decision ever.Little did I know the Capastrami was going to blow the Bobbie out of the water but it did. I have a high standard for pastrami, and this was some good stuff. Thinly sliced, with cole slaw and russian dressing, this sub destroys all subs I've had in recent memory. The bread is great too, nice and soft. Needless to say, the Bobbie was very good, it just took a back seat to the Capastrami real hard. Yes, you've heard that it is Thanksgiving dinner in sub form. I don't know about you guys, but I don't remember the liberal use of mayo at my Thanksgiving dinners. Nevertheless, the mayo doesn't necessarily hurt the sub, and I dig the sweet cranberry sauce mixing with it and the salty stuffing. To top it off, the turkey was tender and very good too.

Our cook was very engaging and hilarious. The service this time was excellent. The food again was awesome, We had the sampler with steak, shrimp, and lobster. I recommend sharing its 10.00 and you get your own soup and salad and if I remember correctly it also includes another appetizer.

I ingested SO much delicious, sugary goodness and washed it all down with too much pink champagne. Too good for the common man, I tell you.I started off with the artisan gelato that was offered as we entered the hallowed halls of the baking room room at LGO. Seriously I felt like I was at Willy Wonka's because there were so many BEAUTIFUL baked goods and LOTS of them. All that was missing was oompa Loompas working the tables and singing cheerful songs. What we got instead were the gracious and talented LGO team offering up their best.A DJ spun some righteous, posh tunes while two candelabras added some atmosphere while I stuffed my face with gelato, cinnamon roll, mini cakes, a lighter than you can imagine English Mufffin and, wait for it, brownies with the French Sea Salt. It's not just for cookies anymore! Now that I think about it, I kind of feel like I was a first year at Hogwarts too. Too much good stuff.Quarters were a little close and it got a little stifling at times, but what else would you expect when you have a small space, lots and lots of good stuff and throw in some Yelpers? Fortunately fans were distributed and I managed to keep cool with the pink champagne.Mondays really suck but I will never complain about a Monday again after tonight........now I think it's time to keep drinking."

Totally worth the 8 hour trip from the East Coast.  We got here around 9pm on a Wednesday and there was no wait.  I had the Ronin Burger.  Japanese cole slaw, caramelized onions, and a fried egg on a burger.  I think I destroyed the burger within a few minutes and it was a decent size.  Every burger shop should add fried eggs on their burgers.  It was sweet and refreshing.  Maybe a little too sweet for my liking, but overall a good burger.  My buddy had the Miyagi-san burger.  With the onion rings, the burger looked massive.  The furikake (seasoning) went very well with the burger.  I had a bite of the burger and the taste still lingered as we walked back to our car.  Next time I'm getting this burger.   As a pork bun enthusiast, I naturally had to order them.  I like Bachi Burger's version of the steam pork bun.  The bun was not soft and fluffy but the pork, egg, and herbs totally blew my mind.  Like I said earlier, eggs should be added be everything.I'm very glad I went here after my flight.  Totally worth the food coma while driving 3 hours to Zion National Park."

After many visits to las vegas, I finally was able to make the time to make a stop by Hot N' Juicy before heading home. Most people prefer Pho to cure their hangovers of course but I made it a point to try this before going back home this trip.I was never a huge fan of Crawfish but I am definitely a fan now! I've tried Crawfish at Boiling Crab and it never stuck to me the way Hot & Juicys did. I usually order Shrimp but after trying Hot & Juicys Crawfish, I've gotten a whole new perspective of cajun food. Their Crawfish was flavorful, soft and melts in your mouth type of seafood. Definitely worth the extra hardwork to peel for those little things!I did try their shrimp and I did not enjoy it very much. It seemed bland and the flavor was lacking. The shrimp just didn't seem as fresh as boiling crabs. I will just have to eat Crawfish at Hot N' Juicy from here on out but definitely worth it.The service was good, they had a friendly staff and they were aware of their customers which I liked. 4/5 because it was great but the only downside was the Shrimp. Will be back for the Crawfish though!"

Professional, clean and very tidy, and great service for an amazing price!!! Funny thing is I always drive past this place on Arville and always see the sign for $20/hour so I always wanted to check it out but the place looks so sketch. Like beside that business the rest of the plaza is abandoned. Once we (my mother and I) walked in we were immediately greeted! My sister came the day before us, and my father went earlier today around noon. Both raved about how good their massage was so Mom and I had to give it a go. We got our massage today around 5pm. They weren't busy at all. And even if they were... They have plenty of beds. Two large rooms at least 25 beds total if not more. My mother and I asked to use their restroom before our massage was to start. Bathroom is very clean and tidy, comfortable and made me know that if the bathroom is this clean I'm sure everything else is clean. We were also asked if we preferred male or female therapist. Mom and I both got male, Mom paired with Peter and myself with Dennis. If you've had a reflexology massage before then you know it differs from a massage envy type of massage in a sense reflexology concentrates on the nerve path and helps to relieve stress and tension and stretches and massages along the nerve path releasing pressure. You stay fully clothed so I would highly recommend wearing loose fit clothing that is easily adjusted as they will massage under the clothes while still on you. Oh and for the females... Wear a bra that hooks only in the back coz they will lift the back of your shirt (while you are laying on your stomach) and unhook the bra to massage full back! Oh yeh... My dad had hot stones placed on his back (he didn't ask for it) but my sister mom and I did not... So idk why some have hot stones and why some don't but it's still amazing!! They will ask while massage if it's too hard or too soft. Do not hesitate to tell them what you want. At one point I had to say a little bit softer coz I just couldn't handle how deep they go. Or I'm just too sensitive. If you want to just relax and have a nice fluffy massage... THIS IS NOT IT. But you want something deep and tension releasing... THIS IS THE SPOT! Dennis is amazing I'm going to ask for him again. And for $20 for a FULL HOUR (I gave a $10tip) but still say just $30 total you cannot beat that price!!!"

Their menu, just like their ingredients, is very simple and lets you customize your burrito/rice bowl in many myriad ways.

I'm always up for trying recommendations at new places so I got the turkey wrap of the day and man was it tasty. I thought it was quite pricy for just a wrap but price of lunch was worth the taste of the dish.On my last day, I stopped again for breakfast and got the eggs-celent burrito with bacon, red onion and salsa. I would definitely order this for breakfast if I was here another morning because breakfast is super cheap! Very filling burrito with a large (and tasty) coffee for around $6.Also, it's worth mentioning that the service here was great. I read one review here that the lady at the counter was rude but I liked her personality. I don't care for the whole ""how is your day, sir? What can I get started for you?"" The menu is on the wall and if you look uncertain, she will gladly recommend an item. When my food was ready, she handed me my to-go bag and said ""thanks Cesar, have a good one."" She paid attention to my name on my credit card and remembered it until I left the restaurant to say thanks. That added to the experience here definitely.

Being a lover of Korean & Korean fusion this was a must-try, and I was not disappointed.They give you A TON of food here.  My honey and I are big folks and big eaters but we agreed afterwards we both should have ordered half orders of our dishes.  He got the bulgogi nachos and I got the bulgogi fried rice.  I ate less than half of mine and was stuffed.  He ate about half of his.  This is a GREAT place to feed a family on a budget!  Alas we didn't have the whole family so we had leftovers.  GET THE HALF ORDER unless you are sharing - you have been warned.I love their chips.  They alone are worth a visit.  And, they serve them with guacamole which is a huge plus.  I would have preferred bigger slices of bulgogi in the rice, it was actually a bit difficult to tell it was bulgogi fried rice vs. some other fried rice, until I put the sweet chili sauce on top which gave it a more distinctly Korean flavor.  The bulgogi nachos had a bit bigger chunks on them, and they were good too - surprisingly a totally different flavor profile than our local DFW korean fusion place's version of korean nachos.The server was very nice, but seemed overwhelmed by the lunch crowd that piled in right after we did.  It's not fast food so don't come when you're in a hurry, but do go.  It's different and it's good and it's a bargain."

Unless you live in the neighborhood, you are not going in unless you have read Yelp or gotten a personal recommendation. Just do it, tastiest budget meal of the week, WITH leftovers.NOT fancy at all as other's have mentioned. Order at a counter, and then have a seat at one of about 8 long rectangular tables and enjoy Bollywood TV until your food is delivered to your table. This is not fast food, so relax and enjoy a different end-of-Fremont street scene view past the fantastic neon street sculptures.No alcohol on the menu, but sounded like on Friday & Saturday nights you can byob like every other street person in Vegas. They were out of the Chicken Marsala which hurt, but we went with their second recommendation of Chili Chicken and Chicken Shmarma. Both were good, we preferred the Chili Chicken the spice level was about a 3/5 and just what we requested. The Gyro also looked fabulous. The Chicken Shmarma was good but would probably have preferred the Chicken Marsala (next year) and a better choice might have been a veggie plate or veggie appetizer to offset two chicken dishes. Instead we ordered the Greek salad which was so big we ate off it the next couple nights as an appetizer with some Chicken Shmarma because we had of course ordered too much food.  LOTS of perfect basmati rice and there were two table seasonings the first I can only describe as whitish, seemed like a light yogurt with light spices that was delicious, and a red that was some kind of light cayenne/ketchup and not hot enuf and a little too sweet for us to add anything to our two chicken dishes. They do take credit cards and the service was helpful and quietly attentive.    Our bill for 3 plates including a huge Greek salad was just under $27 as we had byow, brought our own water. The only two people in Vegas not drinking that night remedied as soon as we got back to our overpriced The Hotel with a $10 refill on one of those huge daiquiri bongs, ahhhhhhh."

Little did I know that it's based on the true story of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons. Their hits included ""Sherry"" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6h0Od2F1wk) and ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzpWKAGvGdA&feature=related).The musical started off a bit slow, but as it progressed, jokes were interspersed here and there, the story became more involving and suspenseful, ending with some of their best songs. The crowd (and we) cheered in standing ovation. It was GOOD!The lead singer playing Frankie Valli (Travis Cloer) sang really well, and the characters all were very convincing. I do not know if the real people they portrayed are that way, but it does not matter -- the acting was excellent and amusing to watch.Many props to the supporting cast. I went in not expecting much, and walked away happy and appreciating the Oldies more. The same was said from my friends.The theater was comfortable, the set very well-designed and fun. They even bumped us to the orchestra seats when there were openings, at no extra charge! We felt a bit odd, however, with us being the only persons in their early 30s among elderlies around us. We got lucky with the free seat upgrade.Good job, guys, with the musical!"

After finding a hybrid water heater at Lowes, you'd think the install would be a breeze. Not so. The subcontractor they use (BSJ Plumbing - see separate review) is unreliable when it comes to communication and quick scheduling. Even the employees at Lowes say they have problems sometimes.When I finally got ahold of the owner, he said he'd check on an install time and call me back. Well guess what? I'm still waiting for the callback.I drove to Lowes, loaded the water heater in my vehicle, got the extra parts and came home - now on day 5 with no hot water. I did a Yelp search for a plumber in my area, and Proskill was the first that came up with amazing reviews. It was a Saturday AM, so I wasn't confident it was going to be easy. I left a message and unfortunately, had to move on to the next call. That person said they could install.No sooner did I hang up, than Garrett from ProSkill called. I told him he was my first choice, but because it had been days with no hot water, I needed to find someone ASAP. He totally understood. Asked me some questions to make sure I had the right material and told me that if something should happen with the other company, to call him (even Saturday evening) and he'd see what he could do?So here's a guy who's not even going to be getting paid, making sure I have what I need with the right info, etc., and offering to come help anyway, if I need it.Subsequently, I've stored Proskill's number in my phone and it will be the first one I call when I need something in the future.

I've been there twice so far, but this review is a reflection of my most recent visit.We arrived on a Sunday evening and the restaurant was not full at all.  There were plenty of empty and cleared tables available.  However, they insisted that we write our name down and wait.  A few more parties arrived after us and they were also instructed to write their name down on the growing list.  (Hmmm...why can't they just seat us?  Don't they see that we have a toddler in hand who is attempting to touch all the business cards and paper junk they have at the front register while we wait?  We could entertain him a lot better if we were seated!)  I could only assume it's because they are understaffed.  Are they hiring?  If not, they should be.When we were finally seated, putting our order in takes a good while too.  Be prepared to wait!  But when you do get your order in, it comes out super fast!  So, that's definitely a plus!We ordered the Nori Ramen - Miso ($8.50) and the Butter Corn Ramen - Shio ($9.00) and upgraded the latter to the larger size ($1.00).  We thought the ramen was fine, although the Husband preferred the broth at another ramen joint we had just visited the day before out of state.On our first visit, we also tried the Mini Pork Chashu Bowl ($2.85).  It's a cute little tiny bowl that is very kid-size friendly or an add-on to your ramen bowl.3.5 stars"

It is easily one of my favorite dishes right now.I've tried both the lemon and tangerine chicken (apparently I could not live without citrus), and while good, they cannot compete with the green curry.  Generally I would prefer Chinese to Thai, or so I thought.  I know, it's like comparing apples to oranges.  I also really like the Tottie rolls.  The spring rolls taught me I'm not a fan of rice paper, but I loved the peanut sauce.

My husband had a 16oz Iced Americano and a frozen chocolate covered banana.I thoroughly enjoyed the soy latte, it was very delicious and filling! The sorbet was also very tasty and fresh. I asked for two scoops when I ordered it and it came in a rather large cup. I did not finish it all as it was just too much for me to eat. I suggest that you plan on sharing if you order 2 scoops!

I was unfamiliar with Chef Kevin Binkley prior to the day of going to Bink's Midtown and now I will be very familiar with all 3 restaurants following my great experience there.  To begin there was a miscommunication with my husband and I resulting in my ordering lunch for both of us and him not being available.  I called a replacement to join me and during this time waiting I had multiple staff members including the Chef stop to check on me.  The server did an excellent job in describing the dishes which lead to my friend and I sampling a few too many.  I enjoyed the ambiance at lunch it was light and airy if it would of been full it would be very easy to hear you neighbors conversations as the tables are close.  The weather was beautiful so the doors were open and my only annoyance during the meal was shooing flies during the beginning of my meal.  I did notice the salt and pepper were missing because I normally need them but the food was so perfectly balanced I never thought of them during the meal.We started with the fried Brussels sprouts which tasted good but I prefer different preparations that result in a softer brussel sprout.  The roasted parsnip soup with poached pears, celery root foam and black pepper honey was amazing.  At first I was tasting the foam and enjoyed the salty flavor and then the soup with pears which was flavorful but needed a little salt and mixing the two brought it to perfection.Next came probably my favorite dish of the week the foie gras beignet with blood orange marmalade.  Listed as an appetizer but would also be great for the end of the meal.  The mousse was light and flavorful the little beignets were perfectly cooked and then the marmalade brought a pleasant sweetness to the dish when I mixed it in for the second beignet.  I did have to ask for a spoon because I couldn't leave any of the mousse behind in the dish.  My friend had the roast beef tri-tip I had ordered for my husband and she loved the flavors and how fresh the sandwich tasted.  It is not a large sandwich but she said with the French fries and dessert it was the perfect size.  Now for the French fries I am an aficionado and they are fabulous especially with the 3 dipping sauces which I normally don't use.  They have a truffle ketchup with was my friends favorite but I loved the light and flavorful salsa vert I was addicted and we both liked the mayo aioli with the light garlic flavor.After seeing the tangelo served at another table I had to have it and it was the exclamation point to the meal.  The tangelo starts with a fairly sharp citrus sorbet that I enjoyed in the center of this large bowel.  It is surrounded by blueberries in the base and purple pillows of foam around the edges topped with mint leaves.  The server was also carrying two containers of fluid with one of them misting.  He poured an orange liquid over my ice cream and immediately followed it with the picture of nitrogen to make my dish a freezing soup.  After waiting for the bubbling to stop I couldn't wait to try the dish and I wasn't disappointed.  The purple pillows are homemade marshmallow with blueberries and I wanted a bowel of just that.  The mint added a nice dimension to the marshmallow and kept it from being to sweet.  The sorbet and frozen soup made a nice pairing of citrus and sweet with out being to sweet and should have been the perfect ending to the meal but we didn't stop.  My friend had the butternut squash ice cream pop which she thought was delicious and she enjoyed how it was served including the extra crumbles for dipping.  She loved the tamarind level in the pop but she never clearly identified where the chocolate was and our server didn't seem to know where the chocolate was either.  Chocolate or no chocolate this dish left no regrets it was very flavorful.As I said we couldn't stop we heard that the baby back ribs were good and so we each had one and they were tasty especial the honey hot sauce served on the side.   The service was great and except for knowing where the chocolate was in the pop provide great descriptions of every item we asked about.  I enjoyed my tea but they seem to have a nice wine list which I can't enjoy during working hours.  I thought the pricing was great and I loved the different sizes available like 1/2 salads, single ribs and the beignets.  The high point for me is the amazing balance of flavors in every dish both savory and sweet.  There was nothing bland or ordinary in any item I ate, what a gem for east Phoenix.I am so lucky as I pass Bink's 5 times a week for work and it will be at least a weekly lunch stop if not more. The parking lot is limited so the use of a valet is quite smart to maximize the spaces available and the tip is more than made up for with the meal and pricing inside."

I went for the original 1762 and it was like bliss touching the lips. Roast beef, cheddar chese, horseradish sauce. Super reasonable prices for anywhere and even better pricing since it is in Vegas. A sandwich is around 7 dollars. I don't know what it is with the bread, but it isn't a standard roll. It's sorta ciabatta-ish but not as tough. It held up to the sauces and meats inside nicely. Great bread.They have grey poupon and yellow mustard at the tables. I found myself using the grey poupon as sort of taqueria hot sauce and adding it on top as I bite into the succulent sandwich.It was so tasty, that we had it for lunch, partied, left at like 3-4am and went back for another one. I had the club this time and it was equally as good. Open 24 hours!"

I'm in the Navy in Virginia and I honestly needed something like this. A Touch of Las Vegas was a pleasant surprise. I expected a decent spa day and such, but they were truly on point in every aspect. They picked me up from the Treasure Island hotel with no problems. The moment I stepped in, they offered fruit and water. The setting is smooth, with a hard rock atmosphere of decades past. It's unique for a spa, but it works with a sense of soothingness. I had an 80 minute massage done by Giselle. She made sure to work with whatever pressure I felt was comfortable with and wanted to constantly ensure that everything was to my standard. She had an excellent personality and was easy to talk to. It's easily possible to be nervous or uncertain during your first ever spa visit, but she made the visit feel natural and put me at ease and comfort. The value is fantastic for what you pay for, so these people really do deserve your tips.I don't often go out of my way to write a review on Yelp, but this place really deserved my time.

No problem the Usher moved us to a booth up front and center stage! We were so close we could smell the sweat of the performer's bodies!Jan Rouven is not only nice to look at and adorable with his German accent, he can really put on a show!The magic/illusion stunts he does are really good, we were extremely entertained with ALL of his acts.He provides for some audience participation which is fun!His dancer's both female and male are awesome as well!Criss Angel should come see this show and take note on what a real illusions show should be! Jan Rouven puts Criss Angel to shame and does not have a nasty cocky attitude that Criss does.After the show Jan came out and signed autographs, and took pictures with everyone!

I had the salmon special and it was really good the fish was nice and fresh not some frozen patty like the food chains, the potatoes were real and so was the spinach. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I am not a big micro brew guy and when I asked what they had they just point to a giant chalk board in the back.

They have a lot of artifacts from the ship, including a huge side panel of the ship which is very impressive. The setup is very well done as well, at one point you walk into a room that is supposed to be a walkway outside of the ship at night, the wind and setup really feels like you are on a cruise ship.

But the Neos commercials were short, witty and appreciated.  However - this is the not the same Neos that you may be familiar with. This new Neos Medspa is under new ownership and management.  I was a little surprised with the small size of the new medspa, but I was also a little relieved.  I was always hesitant about certain procedures because you have to leave most of your modesty at the door and I am a rather modest person.  But the small staff (who are also the owners), and homely office, felt warming and welcoming.  It was definitely less intimidating than other medspas I have considered in the past.Neos was very honest and straightforward with me, they did not try to sell me any product or convince me I needed anything extra. I am easily influenced when it comes to buying things, so this is something appreciated more so by my husband.Since I have Sirius, I don't know if the new Neos Medspa has radio commercials or if they will have the same comical flair, but as long as Tom Shane is not involved, it won't be the most annoying thing on the radio.  If he is involved, I will be doing a review update."

Whew there were so many people in Lawrenceville! It was impossible to get in anywhere and my group wasn't willing to stand outside in the brisk air just to get in and have to fight for seating or even a drink. Soba was the perfect choice! Love, love it here.I have been here to eat before but most nights it's such a busy place that we head elsewhere. Since all of Pittsburgh was on Butler St we got in and sat right down in the lounge next to the glass fireplace! I would love to do a photoshoot in this sexy space. There is always a romantic mood at Soba. Martini glasses clinking in a group cheers, a spectacular setting for a lovely evening and exciting conversation, discussing all the interesting art we just saw.You have to try the Cucumber Martini, it is ""muah"" marvelous! I think my drinks all summer will be Cucumber themed because it is so light and refreshing! I have this thing for Pad Thai, and I am searching the city for the best. So that is what I ordered last time I dined here. It was a pretty decent Pad Thai but I am still looking for one like I had years ago at Papermoon in Erie. It was the best I ever had in my life, no competitors yet. The appetizers I have tried are very good. This is an upscale dining establishment so expect that the food will be as well. They have a small lot that is always packed so you may have to drive around on the small side streets to find parking. I think this is one of the best spots in the city for a date night!"

My second thought: Who cares? Like many of the people on Yelp I am picky about pricing. This place, as noted, is a two dollar sign, but it is exactly that distinction that sets it apart from other restaurants like this. Like Mexican restaurants in the area, there are roughly four thousand places you could get American Chinese cuisine. They range in price and this is probably the high end as far as this type of cuisine goes, but the tangerine chicken will make you forget about the eleven bucks that it costs. This place was a nice reminder that spending an extra four bucks for your meal is usually worth it, especially when you are going to take to the Internet to tell others about it. Also the egg rolls was mad crispy."

It was a Friday night, busy but not packed. The booths were taken, so we sat at one of the glass tables. Service was attentive.  We received 2 perogi to try as we read thru the menu. As a lover of perogi, this small gesture made me very happy!Both my husband and myself ordered the chicken  cordon bleu schnitzel as our meal. It was absolutely delicious. Thin chicken breast with ham and brie cheese, lightly battered with breading, almost a panko type breading. We both tried the mushroom topping as well, but neither of us liked it. They use porcini mushrooms, which are very earthy tasting.  I think it is too overpowering for the already flavorful schnitzel. With the dinners,  you get one side and 3 salads. It is a lot of food. I tried the dill mashed potatoes,  of which you get two large scoops. I also got the cole slaw, beet salad (chopped beets in a cream sauce), and tomatoes with basil. All were delicious. The husband got the rosti (kind of like a potato pancake), tomatoes and basil,  and a side salad with lemon vinagrette dressing. I tasted the dressing and it was a creamy but sweet lemony dressing. We also had ordered an appetizer of perogi before hand. 3 of the 3 cheese and 3 of the meat. Both choices were delicious. We got them with both the onions/bacon and the sour cream. It was 75 cents extra but definitely worth it. Try the pan fried option. The 2 perogi they brought initially were deep fried and we didn't care for them as much. Overall we were super pleased with our meal. It is a little more in cost than our usual places we eat at weekly, but very high quality and flavor. We will be back for sure!"

I had the summer tasting menu paired with some amazing wines. The food was AMAZING! So much flavor and appropriate size portions for an upscale restaurant.

For us, it was nice to have a blast to the past, complete with costumes, music, and the wonderful videos on the wall.  For all you youngsters reading this, MTV used to play videos. All the time. Seriously!  It was a golden age of television. =)Drinks are not cheap (particularly when you can get drinks for free right outside the place), so perhaps a pre-drinking session is in order. As the name suggests, there are tons of drinks that are bourbon based, but there isn't the largest selection of bourbons.  I did find it amusing that there is a menu of Bartles and Jaymes wine coolers, to truly bring you back. The servers, according to one of them, are all professional dancers, which makes sense that they perhaps aren't the best at actually serving drinks.  Jim G. asked our server what IPAs they had. Her response was, ""IPA? What's that?""  He quickly responded by saying, ""Just bring me a Coors Light."" Fun music, fun 'performances' by the dancers and the DJ, fun dancing to be done.  As long as you like this music and the cheesiness of the scene, you'll have a good time.  If you're trying to hook up for the night, then be sure you're in the late 30's+ scene and perhaps lower your standards. =)  As a tip, the Venetian has created a small gambling space right outside the club (which is very open for all to see) where there are some tables; this way you can enjoy the music and the vibe while still gambling.  Best of both worlds? Depends on your luck, I suppose."

For me, the only experience that I've had with a decent hot dog was from Costco. Luckily, I curiously found myself stumbling upon one of my newest regular hot stops for food: The Lunch BoxA look at the menu shows that the owner keeps things simple. There are usually about 5 or 6 different styles of hot dog (also available in turkey or soy). Here's some of them that I've tried:-Chicago (mustard, sweet relish, onion, tomatoes, kosher pickle, & sport peppers) - A more basic approach to the standard hot dog that I'm accustomed to. Tasted great. Plus, got it for $2 for reading a Twitter deal from the owner.-Milwaukee Brat - Spicy brown mustard, caramelized onion, saurkraut. Solid brat. Carmelized onions were a nice touch. I didn't think it was anything to write home about, but still good nonetheless.-Chilean (mustard, spicy mayo, avocado, tomatoes & sauerkraut) - Another one of my favorites. The spicy mayo kick and fresh avocado slices make this one shine.-SoÌ±oran (mustard, mayo, bacon, bbq beans, tomato, onion, queso fresco, and salsa verde on bolillo roll)- This thing is a monster. Plus, it has bacon in it. Can't go wrong with bacon. Probably my favorite item. But man, it has a lot going on in it. I could only make it a once in a while thing to eat this.The owner puts on a one-man show here. Orders take a few minutes, a tad bit longer if you roll with a turkey dog. This is something I don't mind, since something so delicious shouldn't come instantly.The prices are good, the food is awesome, and you can tell that the owner loves what he does. It's because of this that I've prescribed myself at least 1 Chilean a week."

Best choice on eats I've made in awhile!First off, the location itself.  There is a patio facing east.  If you get there at the right time, you can enjoy a beautiful evening with your awesome food.  The inside is very cozy with a great, open floor plan.  You can see all of the friendly staff preparing your meal behind glass near the front.  I wasn't sure what to order so the manager, Ben, gave me a few of his recommendations.  After an awesome conversation, I decided on the Turkey BLT (Grilled carved turkey, smoked paprika mayo, applewood bacon, oven roasted tomatoes with romaine on sourdough) with a Citrus Basil Salad (Spring mix, citrus wedges, cucumber, fennel, caramelized walnuts with citrus basi vinaigrette).I watched them preparing a salad while I placed my order.  The girl behind the counter had just finished grilling a delicious piece of tri-tip steak.  She chopped it up and paced atop the salad.  I know what I'll be getting with my meal next time I'm here.  Looked delicious!The food came and the line began to grow.  I arrived at the perfect time to beat the lunch rush.  My stomach was growling and it was on!  The sandwich looked like something out of a photo shoot.  Everything about it looked perfect.  The right portions of grilled turkey breast, crisp, green romaine that hung perfectly out the edges of the bread.  Speaking of the bread, it was incredibly fresh and flavorful.  One bite and I knew I was in love.  The girlfriend and I were blown away by the quality of the turkey breast.  It was grilled perfectly and had the perfect consistency.  The greens gave a great, refreshing taste to accent the turkey.  The smoked paprika mayo danced on my tongue and was the perfect amount.  The bacon was crisp and neither too thick nor too thin.  It added the perfect amount of smokiness to chase the flavor of the sandwich.My girlfriend loved the salad.  I had several bites and will agree with many before me that have said Market Bistro has the freshest most flavorful greens around.  I felt exponentially healthier just looking at the beauty of it.  The caramelized walnuts added the perfect counter sweetness to the citrus of the dressing and fruits.Do I recommend Market Bistro?  Absolutely!  If you enjoy Paradise Bakery you will fall in love with Market Bistro.  It's the equivalent of Paradise perfected.  Kudo's to my new favorite salad and sandwich place.  Also worth mentioning is their awesome selection of music (they have their own station on Pandora!).  You'll feel like kicking your feet up on the couch near the front and relaxing after your stomach is full!"

So reasonably priced it is silly.  We started with the Pig Wings (mini pork shanks) and guacamole with chips, and the freshness screams off the plate.  Three tacos and the shrimp and corn tamale later, and I was weeping with joy.  Super fresh ingredients, combined like a well tuned orchestra; and the sweet and spice in the tamale was literally the best tamale I have ever eaten.  I do not know how they get away with such reasonable prices.  The place is small, but not crowded or loud.  It is so clean, you feel like you could eat off the table or floor - but not too sterile!  It's dimly lit, but not too dark; and the staff seem to really enjoy their job!  They are attentive, friendly, thoughtful, and greet and visit with diners like family!  The butcher was closed, but I have heard good things!  Seriously, this place is an absolute don't miss.  Next time, I want to eat outside, on the super-inviting patio with the fountain.

So soft, so comfortable, so hard to get out of...Beyond that, I would call the Kierland more hotel than resort.  The Kierland was quite obviously built to house large conferences and events and that cuts into the 'resort' feel.  The lobby, while dramatic, is a bit stark and cold and several of the rooms overlook roofs for the ballroom or the main hotel entrance with it's proximity to the busy Scottsdale Road.However some rooms, especially those on the golf-course side of the hotel, are wonderfully peaceful.  Ask for a room overlooking the Sandpainter's Courtyard - I would step out onto my balcony to listen to birdsong and enjoy the quiet.The staff is beyond gracious, the rooms are spacious and the wealth of Arizona history lining the hallways is amazing.  The Kierland was built on land held by longtime Arizona residents with a passion for history and culture and that heritage is on full and wonderful display here.Bottom line - do not expect a typical 'resort' feel, but still consider this hotel a great option for the area.

First time was a CUT + DYE (lightest shade without bleaching my hair): $80 total. Dye can cost more/ombre etc. I've been here twice now to see Kathy. After reading shimmering reviews of her, I felt that I had to try it. The first time I went here, I decided to dye my hair a rich coffee milk color. It was my first time dying my hair ever. Made me wish that I went through an existential punk-rock-overuse-of-black-eyeliner phase in high school. I felt super nervous while picking out my color. Kathy is quiet, reserved, and takes a while to warm up to you. I appreciated that I wasn't pressured to make conversation. She gave her advice on a first-time color without being condescending.After washing my hair thoroughly and ""painting"" the dye into my hair delicately and confidently, I started to relax a bit. She left me to work on another customer (talk about awesome multi-tasking) while my hair marinated in the head electric chair for around...20 minutes or so? I was busy reading entertaining 1-star Twilight book reviews to notice.  When my hair was done toasting, she washed and blow- dried it.She told me, ""okay don't freak out when you see your hair."" Needless to say, I freaked out harder than Bella losing Edward in New Moon. God, those books were awful. It's shocking when you see yourself with a totally different color than the one you're born with. It's like waking up and realizing that your thumb is gone and replaced with a can opener. Only, you know, probably less traumatizing in my case. I told her exactly what I wanted. Three inches of hair off and a trim on my layers. I wanted this be more layered than an onion. Kathy listened and sliced my hair with the precision of sculpting feather-thin details. I was surprised she cut my tresses so quickly. I can't stand choppy layers (I'm lookin' at you SuperCuts/GreatClips!!) She didn't over flatiron my hair too much and gave it plenty of volume in the style. My hair still looked awesome 6 months later (only much longer, trashier with the roots showing, and abused by split ends but hey!). Each strand blended nicely and intricately into the next. When I went to visit my mom on a trip recently before the second cut, she said ""oh good, this haircut looks much better than the last! The one you had before was ugly."" (The very first thing she told me was to ""get a white boyfrand ok?? More money."" oh geez).  Second time around, I couldn't be happier. I just had a regular cut ($30) done recently without a re-dye. Prices are steep. But I don't mind so much because I felt more than satisfied.Kathy is quick, but she paid attention to my hair, and captured the very style I wanted. Definitely sticking to her as my stylist."

Overall 4 stars, one visit was earlier Saturday the other was later sunday.For our first visit, we went for breakfast. We were immediately seated, no waiting. Wait staff were prompt and friendly, however, not very efficient. I noticed on 4 different occasions of them taking food orders to incorrect tables.Aside from that the food was awesome. The wife and I both had breakfast skillets, they were cooked perfectly and portions were spot on. We left full and happy!For our sunday visit, we showed up closer to 11am. Told the wait was about 25mins, which it was. Staff were friendly and appeared to be much more efficient this visit. The wife ordered breakfast, Chicken Fried Steak and it was very delicious! I had the beef dip, which was average at best. The beef and au jus just didn't have enough flavor and the fries were soggy. So, I'd say 3 stars this visit, close to 5 the first, would be an easy 4 overall.On sunday this place was literally a zoo, people packed everywhere, kids screaming/crying, rude people in the parking lot. I'd rx going early to avoid the rush if you are the type of person that gets anxious easily."

These things are awesome. Possibly the best ones I have had here. Every time I have ever been there it has been packed even at like 1 am so the rest of the food can't be that bad. The restaurant it's self is not in the best condition. It's in an older building. So don't expect to much from the decor. Service is nothing exceptional either.

It has a smaller number of vendors but the quality is excellent.  I was very pleased with the Door County cherries that I picked up today.  The less crowded atmosphere allowed you more time to browse and select the best quality produce without feeling rushed.  There are some vendors that have spots at Dane County, like Stella's and Madison Sourdough, but you get some smaller local vendors as well.  Parking is easily available on the lot or on the street and you don't have pay for it, always a plus.

I absolutely love this workout. Since joining I have lost 15lbs and my body fat has changed from 33% to 16%. Dan Durso and Kim Brown are two of the trainers at OTF that have been extremely helpful in my success. Both truly care about every single person they are training. I love that their classes are challenging and targeting each muscle group. They mix up the strength/lifting so it's not routine each class you attend. They motivate and push their clients to challenge themselves. If you have questions or need suggestions on how to reach your goals they will make time to talk individually with you. It's obviously not just a job for them, but a passion for helping clients reach their fitness goals. In addition to being amazing trainers, they are very knowledgeable on nutrition and supplements to enhance the results one is looking for on top of the workout. Kathy Curran is an amazing nutritionist at OTF PV. She has made such an impact on my eating and lifestyle. If I had a question not only would she answer it, but would find an article to justify what she was saying. Julie Kraiss and Kristin Bennett work the front desk and every time I come in they are so welcoming. They motivate everyone that walks in and are always concerned about the clients' experiences.Orange Theory Fitness, Paradise Valley continues to impress me, and I will definitely refer more people to this workout and location."

I've not had milk and cookies since I was a kid, and it was all that I remembered it to be. The cookies were an assortment of gourmet locally made gems so whatever type of cookie you remember from your childhood, it's probably represented here.

Of course I had introduced this place to many of my co workers and they have gone there many times. I have one who works in Vegas that goes there like every other day. Ya you Dannette!!!They had some new rolls and added super white tuna (ONO) since my last visit. Garlic tuna still my fav. Their spicy tuna is actually really spicy which is rare. Most places just use some red sauce and make it look like its spicy when its not. heres my run down of my fav:1. garlic tune2. super white tuna3. eal4. wet dream roll5. moon roll6. kasia rollWe pretty much took up the whole restaurant except 1 booth and the sushi bar. Everything was great except few hiccups, because of the large group and being somewhat spread out, orders came out slow and some people got their food and some didn't. I don't think they expected such a group or experienced such a load at one time. Even though I called few days before to make a res for 25 people. What I learned was as much as I like Sin City Sushi they cant handle a group of more than 16 in my opinion. Next time, when I call to make a res. I will ask them if they will staff enough to accommodate us otherwise I'm just gonna take a group of 16 only. Believe me they did their best and I appreciate that. That's why I still tell all my friends about this place. If I lived in Vegas I'd be here quite often.TWO things I do appreciate about Sin City Sushi:1. they were able to give us separate checks2. There is never a time limit which is great since we have a group and hard to finish in 1 hour.WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK SOON!!!"

I'm going to award it the mighty 5-stars under the assumption you go on a brewery tour like I did.  Having been on a brewery and winery tours I can easily say this was far and away the best tour I've ever taken, nothing else even comes close.  The guy giving the tour was as he admitted not the usual fellow who gives them but he said he was starting to give more and more and hopefully for you he does.  Unfortunately, I cannot remember his name at the moment he is one of the brewmaster, a short little guy and a hell of a nice guy and great at making the tour interesting and keeping things really loose.  If you haven't been on brewery tours before, they can somewhat boring after a while, unless you are really and I mean really passionate about it.  It's a lot of tanks and containers.  While Ale Asylum has these elements the fact that we got to walk in between the tanks, get up there and see and smell bubbling yeast, the bottling machine, really walk among the facility was a kind of closeness I've never had before.  Additionally, the tour comes with free drinks, what isn't amazing about that?  In order to even enter the brewery area, everyone by guide order HAD to have a drink in hand.  The beer itself is very flavorful, as someone who also writes the occasional beer review too, the various styles of beer they have are all quite robust in their flavor with strong bodies and a good but not overpowering finish.  Their porter has a nice coffee roast to it, the summer ale is refreshing and light, and their IPA is a mother of a IPA, great if you like a really hoppy one.  Overall, none of their styles is tremendously different from its designation, the porter tastes like porter, the wheat ale like wheat ale, the snozberries like snozberries but all of them are really great representation of their respective type.I was fortunate enough to also get to snack on a pizza which had a surprising amount of spice to it, a nice treat.  Much better than typical bar food and pizza that could hold its on.This tour was great if you haven't been on one before and want to this is the place to do it.  There were folks on our tour who were actually on their second tour of duty.  I can't testify to how it is in the evening but it's more classy and cleanly presented inside than most bars which again sets the AA apart.  It's a nice looking place inside, with a nice staff, and some nice beverages and eats.  Yeah, a visit to the Ale Asylum...NICE!"

It is literally just a stones throw away from the students playground, George Square, so you could not get a closer place to go to for your lunch. I am a huge fan or this place, and they serve so much more than coffee, in fact, I have never ordered a coffee from Coffee Etc. They serve really delicious wraps, filled with almost anything you want. They offer a huge range of authentic ethnic cuisine such as falafel, hummus, babaganous and kidney beans, as well as the more traditional fillings such as mozzarella cheese, salad, kidney beans, and a selection of meats. I love their hummus and falafel wrap served with a spicy sauce and I find that when I eat one of their wraps for lunch, I am not feeling hungry for the rest of the day.Coffee Etc offer a huge range of non-meat options so it is a great place for vegetarian's as they will definitely find something on the menu which they fancy. The prices are incredibly reasonable here to, with a wrap costing about å£3.50. Coffee Etc toast their wraps and is lovely to eat a wrap wrap on a cold day. There is a small seating area inside Coffee Etc which is cosy with comfy chairs, but can get quite cramped during the lunch time rush so I tend to take my food as a take away. The staff are also very friendly and will to explain all the exotic dishes on the menu which they offer. Coffee Etc also sell a range of ethnic teas. It is definitely worth a visit."

For first timers I would recommend staying away from the turkey sandwich's because a lot of people seem to think they are ""dry"". If I ever hear complaints about this place its because its not standard as far as sandwich shops go. What I mean by this is that they don't serve your standard BLT/Turkey club like a subway or a port of sub. If your craving taste like that its best to get what hits the spot. On the other hand if you want a new taste that will blow your mind then stop by Cap's. As a constant return customer my only complaint is that they don't stay open long enough. Most locations seem to close at 7pm and they have no 24hr locations which is a bummer. I have recently discovered that the locations inside of casinos are open till 11pm which is awesome! My all time favorite sandwich here is the Capastrami. If the kinda sandwich that makes me smile every time I bite into it :) I also constantly enjoy the cheese steak and grilled Italian. I would recommend this sandwich shop to anyone who love sandwich's. I usually leave paying between $10-18 depending on what location I visit.

We asked security nearby and they said they shortened their hours to 11-4 during the week and 24 hrs only on the weekend.  He said they were slow at night.  I was expecting a line.  That didn't seem like a good sign.  Less then a month and already cutting back on hours.  Is the SLS that dead?  Damn.  Turns out it is 11pm-4pm.  So not near as bad as 11am-4pm we took it as.

Yup-I've had more boyfriends than published reviews on Yelp. Anyway, this time we actually go places, which is nice. I have been searching somewhat fruitlessly for a Mexican place better than Pinto in Glasgow. I think I may have found it, however they don't put any salsa on the Quesadillas, which is a big part of the experience for me. Apparently he had 'booked a table' but when we walked in, it didn't look like the kind of place where you had to book-there were only three tables. I had chicken quesadillas with black bean salsa. Next time I'd go for a different salsa-because this was more like a hodge podge collection of corn and beans. We also got a side of tortilla chips with the verde salsa. It tasted okay, but I wouldn't choose it again. I'm giving this a four because of the quesadilla on its own. The spices the chicken were cooked in were bloody great. It was just a great quesadilla. I'm not in Edinburgh very much anymore, but if I am, I'll be here again. However, I'll take away- it's a bit cold inside!"

We went up to our room and something was not quite right.  Looked in the bathroom, no tub, no door to the toilet area, weird kind of high and open sinks.  Right, we got a handicapped room.  Not tub for the wife was a show stopper.  Went back to the high end check in area with an obvious look of displeasure and told them that they should inform guests of putting them into this type of room if they are not disabled.Anyway I maintained calmness and asked for another room.  None of my upgraded type available.  No big deal upgrade me some more, they did and got a Sienna suite.  Very nice.Only problem here is the level of amenities in the bathroom.  No q-tips, no cotton balls, no whatever, basically soap and shampoo.  You would think the large suite would be fully stocked.Had a great time in a cabana at Azure on Saturday.

We were seated in a private dining room next to the wine cellar - very cool!We went all out by ordering crab cakes and king crab appetizers - delicious.  Then everybody ordered their entrees and we picked three sides: lobster mac n cheese, asparagus and creamed spinach to share.  I had the 8 oz filet.  All the sides arrived piping hot and were served to us on the sizzling dinner plate that the steak was served on.  Interesting that as your steak was served they asked that you cut into it right through the middle to ensure that the doneness was as you ordered -  I never experienced that at a steak house.  Of course mine was cooked to specification at medium rare, appeared to be simply seasoned with salt/pepper and the meat was a wet aged prime cut that was as tender as it was flavorful.  We enjoyed Prisoner wine that complimented our meal wonderfully and the wine service was expert with the wine properly decanted and served from carafe.  Anxious to return for another meal here with my wife......the vibe in the bar with a piano player vocalist was good energy."

We decided to stop by on a Saturday. I introduced my friends to Waterworks Mall (more importantly, Five Below!) & then we decided to have a late lunch here since our one friend is actually from Egypt- we figured he could help us order.We ordered the Kibbie & Dawali as appetizers. Wow, the Kibbie was great and full of amazing flavor. I truly didnt know what I was missing until I tried that! Our friend joked around that his mother can make it better, but I really don't know how. Aladdin's Kibbie was pretty tasty. The Dawali was okay.. a little too sour due to too much garlic & lemon (a little goes a looong way) but we put it on our fresh pita bread and made it work. Not too bad at all.For lunch, I ordered the Flavor Savor Special which is Chicken Mishwi, Beef Kafta, seasoned rice, salad & hummus. Now that's a true flavor savor! I enjoyed everything & became full pretty quickly from our double appetizer. I only finished half & the waitress was kind enough to box it for me & add SUPER fresh pita. Bobby enjoyed it later after missing out on our awesome trip.Overall, the food was flavorful & filling;. The service was okay & we had a nice time. I debated on giving Aladdin's a 3 star for an A-ok rating, but the fact that they make  really fresh food plus have many options for GF & vegetarians knocks it up a notch. Good times!"

When we returned to the casino in July, we were curious about the changes that were made to the recently reopened restaurant.  ""How can you improve on excellence?"", we wondered aloud.  Well, Bally's nailed it.  The former Bally's Steakhouse has been rebranded as BLT Steakhouse and the upgrade shows.  The new configuration of the dining room is perfect for a brunch due to the addition of a dedicated serving area.  The finishes are clean, modern, and comfortable and add an openness to the space that was previously lacking. I didn't think they could improve on the food, but they did.  Delicious Nueske's Slab bacon was added to the carving station as well as a scrumptious chocolate-peanut butter mousse added to the dessert station.  The omelet bar was still turning out awesome eggs and the cold shellfish station was still a winner.  Of course, the Perrier Jouet champagne flowed freely and the service was impeccable, thanks to our server Diane.  Thanks, Bally's!  We'll certainly return to try dinner at the steakhouse!"

This place is not close to the Strip its a little past DTLV, but in my opinion, it's totally worth the drive to get some cheap yummy Mexican treats. The place is located in a small kind of run down business/shopping center. Do not let it scare you, it is safe as for what you find inside will totally be worth it! Walking in the first thing, I see is a couple of bags left of my precious snack that I have been longing for, Duroa de Harina with lime and chili salt (or in English wheat pinwheels ).They also have helado (Mexican ice cream) that is made fresh in house; some of the flavors that I saw there were:Fresa-StrawberryGuayaba-GuavaMangoPina-PineappleLimeBubble Gumand a bunch more that I could not see because not only is this place super small, but after 5:00pm on a weekday, this is the place to be after a hard day at work or school!If you do order ice cream they offer a free topping as well, which is great! They have a nice selection of agua frescas (Horchata, Tamarind and Melon). If you are not wanting desert right away then they also have tacos and burritos too, which the boyfriend and I decided that we will have to try the next time we are in town!They also have Smoothies, Tostilocos (one of my favorites) an assortment of Mexican candy as well!Prices are amazing for a single scoop of ice cream and my bag of Duroa de Harina it came to under $8.00. Note: If you are not certain on how a flavor will taste you can try a sample of it. Everyone working there was very nice and helpful. The parking lot can be a bit of a zoo; we parked toward the end where there were a couple of extra spaces."

Is it South Beach? New York? LA?  And I caught myself doing the same thing sitting on Bomberos patio when I decided it belongs to Phoenix, pure and simply.  The architecture of the building, the patio, hot & sweaty nights, latin music playing in the background, all reminiscent of our great city. We sat on the beautiful patio, with twinkling candles, mesquite trees acting as a makeshift umbrella, with comfy patio furniture.  There are several nice features on the patio - a fountain, fire pit, lots of candles and a beautiful piece of candle wall art.  Even though there were only two occupied tables on the patio that night, they still came out and lit all 50+ candles. I ordered a fabulous glass of wine, I wish I could remember the name to recommend - I do remember it was white and from Argentina. For food we ordered the salad of the day, bruschetta, the salami pesto Panini and the chocolate espresso torte.  All were good, but the dessert was delectable.  I wanted to give this place 5 stars because I really dug it, but had to deduct a star for the following:1. Bringing out our salad with our entrees when we clearly ordered it as an app. 2. A panini that was painful to bite into, it seriously scratched the roof of your mouth.3. A beautiful fire pit, but is it really necessary in the 100+ heat? 4. Good bruschetta, but not as good as Postino. Our waiter told us that they open at 7am and to come in for a glass of morning wine.  A glass of wine before work?  Now there's a novel idea."

I know everyone swoons over the fountains outside but those can get old after a while. Especially in the middle of summer, it is nice to have something that you can enjoy in the air conditioned comfort of the indoors but still get plenty of sunshine and the feeling of strolling thru an outdoor garden. The flowers and plants in the Bellagio Conservatory are arranged in meticulously constructed works of living art that will amaze and delight you. They usually try to incorporate some moving pieces and a water feature so the scene will captivate everyone's attention, even small children. The best part is that the whole thing is completely redone every couple of months with a different theme. Even though they obviously reuse some of the same props from year to year, especially for specific holidays, I have walked thru the Bellagio Gardens dozens of times over the years and never seen the exact same display more than once.  It is not a large area but I suggest planning to spend about an hour to enjoy it all since there is just so much to see.

So I must have been in the mood for eggplant because I got a pesto eggplant panini with tomato and basil but I had difficulty choosing from this and the caprese panini with balsamic glaze, pesto and sundried tomatoes. I'll have to come back for that one.  This place is Kosher in all senses of the word.   It has all the feeling of a family restaurant down to high attention to detail and customer service.  I hope to see some yelps pop up about a well kept Scottsdale secret.  In the meantime I'm going to introduce them to yelp and make sure we can find them when searching the yelps. Especially when they are the little whole in the walls we are sifting through the corporate eateries in order to keep them keep us sustainable with good food."

The course has always been in good shape during my visits, with a large range and heaving, rolling putting green available to get you warmed up.The course boasts holes of varying length, which will have you reaching for just about every club in your bag at one point or another.The greens are large and fast, but receptive, and the bunkers are large and deep but playable.I have two favorite holes at Ballantyne: the short dogleg right 3rd and the longer dogleg left 18th. The third is a nearly 90 degree dogleg that forces a decision off the tee...do I take the aggressive route with a driver, aim over the trees and brush and potentially drive the green, or play it safe straightaway, leaving a wedge in my hands for my second shot.I love holes that offer this kind of risk-reward opportunity.The 18th is the signature hole at Ballantyne. You tee-off from an elevated tee towards the majestic hotel. The fairway bends left towards the green, with a creek on the left and lake on the right. The green is large, tiered and bunkered.Navigate it safely and you're ready for the 19th hole. Or, if you're like me, you're ready for the 19th hole regardless!"

The good thing is its a cramped store full of good stuff.  If you're a aged cigar or gem hunter like me, this aspect becomes a very positive thing as I'm finding things that wouldn't be around at minimally stocked store to high. They can keep ""losing"" stuff in their humidor so I can ""find"" them years later. What sets it above too is that the customer service is great here. Dylan and Billy are easy going, friendly and are all about helping you and making you happy. There is another location that is close to our house on Lake Mead. It is bigger and convenient to us but after going here and seeing the difference we will be driving here instead.  Why? Not that they aren't helpful at the other one but  I am not just someone who likes to purchase, I want to be a regular. Within a few visits, I feel comfortable here and would rather smoke here and talk with these guys...there's just something extra there. I smoked a LFD chiselito on my last visit and we've had some really nice chats with Dylan. Just the vibe is varied.... you would think its two owners based on how different the two shops are run. I live in the far NW and will come to the SE just for this. I definitely think if they've gone above and beyond on my first visits, then I am a a fan right off the bat and will try to come by more often."

I'd have to say that this place is one of the best. The atmosphere is always hustling and bustling. They're almost always busy. If you go at night, be prepared to wait in line. They will not seat you if your entire party has not all arrived!! I felt bad today because my friend and I got in before these two couples who were waiting on one more person to complete their group. But oh well, there's a sign up that details this rule, with ""No Exceptions!"" We were seated quickly. Our hostess had eyeliner that she drew to the corner of her eye and beyond. I thought it looked cool, like a character out of star trek or something. Within no time, they served up the free chips and salsa. The salsa was home made, and very good. The super hot salsa is extremely hot, and will make you sweat. I ended up ordering Camarones Diabla (I took a picture of it and placed it in the gallery here). I almost always order this dish when I go to the more authentic Mexican restaurants. The dish was very good, the sauce was perfect. Although I could've used a little more spice. They also put a lot of shrimp in it. One thing I will complain about though, is that I think they would've done better by deveining the shrimp. Also there were still a couple shrimp peels that hadn't been completely peeled off, so I did it myself. Regardless of those minor details, the dish was still superb. I've had their pulled pork soft tacos on previous visits. Those are also very good. Especially when you put that super hot salsa on it. Their tacos are definitely way better than Taco Bell. The service was great, my water was constantly being refilled, and the waitress kept calling me amigo, making me feel like she doesn't hate me and that I'm part of her extended family. I welcome that kind of affection. This is a great Mexican restaurant. I would definitely return, recommend, and bring amigos."

Bummer that a regular drop-in class is $16 (or 5 for $64) cause that's a little bit out of my price range. Very happy I could do it through the Groupon. Fun! Definitely totally different than our usual gym cardio. I was having trouble registering to pay with the Groupon through their website so I emailed them and they got back to me quickly and took care of the registration. It is NOT an easy, laid-back kind of yoga class. I was sweating like crazy trying to follow along. I was ultimately able to do all the moves but not without some serious effort. I'm in pretty good shape and so is my boyfriend but we struggled sometimes to get into the poses - especially hanging upside-down in Bat Pose. I would be hesitant to recommend it to someone who can't do a bent-arm hang for 5-10 seconds. I think they'd end up having to sit out more moves than they are able to do.The instructor explains the move as she's doing it and the class moves along quickly - especially since it was our first class so we spent the first few seconds watching her to figure out what we were supposed to do. No doubt we'll be better able to transition from move to move in the next class.Regarding Julie B's comment on the instructor: Almost everyone in my session was there for the first time. They did a Groupon and probably got 1000 purchasers. The class is only an hour long and to have to personally greet everyone and encourage them and ask everyone if they have any questions every time you teach the class wouldn't be realistic. Personally, I teach a rowing class and I never know who's going to stick with it and who will never show up again. I could spend 20 minutes playing ice-breaker games so everyone gets to know each other or I could spend 20 minutes teaching you to row and figure you'll come back if you like it or not come back if you don't.  It doesn't mean the instructor is unfriendly or unwelcoming or rude, I think it's a matter of only having 60 minutes and teaching something complicated to a bunch of people who got a Groupon and probably won't be back once it's used up. A suggestion for Tough Lotus: it was hard to see the instructor because of all the swings in the way. And I was in the front row (there was a swing in between me and her so I had to step around it to watch). It would be great to have the instructor perform the moves on an elevated platform or something. Then we could all watch and do at the same time rather than having to duck down/around the other swings to be able to see."

I came about an hour early before my treatments to use the facilities. They have the rain showers, large hot tub, steam room, sauna and a cold dipping pool. They have nice amenities such as hair care, body lotion, shavers, hair ties, toothbrush, trail mix, juices, and tea.I've had two massages here and both times the male therapists were amazing and worked out the kinks as much as they could given the 50 minutes I booked.After the massage, I got a facial and it was so relaxing that I fell asleep, minus the part when the esthetician did the extractions.The attendants were nice and cordial and asked periodically if I needed anything. The facilities itself are clean.Yes I would definitely come back."

Brunch has been our favorite experience there-- on the patio with bloody marys, can't be beat. The appetizers really stand out-- the warm kale dip is the perfect starter and I find myself oftentimes craving the Brie toast with pomegranate seeds. For earlier breakfast options my husband is addicted to the quinoa burrito but I'll opt for the green smoothie- so fab. The dinner options we've tried were less than stellar until our last trip where I got the flank steak and have been thinking about it since. SO good. The cocktails are surprising mixes -- I think I've tried each of them a few times. The upstate gentleman is a standout as is the fig mule. Ambiance is awesome, servers and hosts are friendly and the fact that I can walk there make this place a solid 4 stars."

But my wife had a gift certificate and wanted to explore the Kierland area shops and restaurants.We made reservations for 5:30 on the patio. We waited for about 5 minutes for our table to be cleaned and were escorted to our table on the patio. Talk about living large, a patio overlooking the shops and the courtyard which was accented with a bunch of palm trees on a beautiful 80 degree day. The ambiance alone rates an extra star.We started off with the Trio for $9, which is 4 pieces of bread (which was refilled) and with generous amounts of Hummus, an Olive spread, and Goat Cheese. All spreads were delicious. My favorite was the Goat Cheese, WOW! My first time to eat Goat Cheese and I am definitely hooked.We lucked out an had a great server, I believe her name was Bree. Kudos Bree! Bree helped us with the menu items.My son had the Chicken Parmasean and didn't share any with me. So I'm thinking that was really good and I should order some next time. My wife went out of her comfort zone and ordered the Buccatini which is Short Ribs and Spaghetti, WIN! I ordered the Flank Steak which was topped with fresh Arugula greens. The steak was fabulous, they serve you what seems to be two steaks that are cut in strips. Plenty of food, I had a hard time finishing off the steak since it was so much. We then relaxed and had a great post meal family conversation. All and all, a very enjoyable evening out for $70 (no alcohol) before tip and gift card."

I have to write about something life altering.  I needed to share with the rest of the world my experience at Joe's.  We begin the dinner with an appetizer of stone crabs.  If you have never eaten stone crabs before...think crab with a hint of sweetness.  The stone crabs are cracked, so you just have to peel away with ease and enjoy.  For our main entrees husband and I are all business and get steaks.  Please note that all menu items are a la carte, so any kind of side must be ordered seperately.  My husband opts for the ribeye cooked medium, and I get the filet mignon (also cooked medium).  I took one bite of my steak, closed my eyes, and I swear the restaurant went quiet. It was one of those moments. For our sides we share a serving of mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach with garlic.  Both were very delicious and complimented the steak really well.  Lastly for dessert we were unsure of what to choose from because they had such a long list of pies.  Our waiter Ben suggested we share a slice of banana creme pie with fosters sauce (apparently his favorite).  Ben..if you are reading this review...you are a genius!If I lived in Las Vegas I would be totally broke.  Not because I would gamble my savings away.  It would be because I would have a permanent seat at Joe's.  The food is on another level, and the service is incredible.  If you're ever in Vegas and want a real good meal without the Legassi or Flay name stamped onto it, dine at Joe's...you won't regret it."

She was curious about everyone's food taking a photo of me every time I sunk my teeth into the over-sized $13.00 burger.The server was fabulous checking up on us frequently; however only exception was the busboy and hostess did not bring the Cucumber ranch dressing my friend was eating in a bowl large enough to fit a 10 pound cat.

It's very nicely decorated, and personally, I think it transports you to an experience that could be happening in New York, Chicago, etc.  Not that being in those places would be better, it's just that GFOM puts off a very cosmopolitan vibe.If there was a single low note to our visit, it was that our candle went out, and our waitress forgot our request for a lit one.

We swiped a lit candle from a neighboring table when they left and it was all good from that point on."

Went here last night after trying and not being thrilled with another restaurant in the area. This was the greatest little find ever! The food was fantastic and service was amazing. We had a huge bowl mussels which we slopped up with the homemade bread. I had a white cream garlic sauce pasta with chicken, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, and tons of garlic (and I mean tons!) It was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever eaten. Husband had a spicy red sauce that was very flavorful with tons on pancetta. Both dishes has really wonderful fresh spinach pasta. Portions were huge and had leftover which I had today which almost tasted even better after soaking up all that yummy sauce. I'm telling you, you have to try this place. We will definitely be back for top notch Italian food!"

I don't think I've ever eaten or drank something here that I haven't liked! a couple dishes have really stuck with me because they were too delicious to forget.. like the seared sesame tuna, and the truffle fries! Among the fusion sushi specialties, I'm not even going to attempt listing all the good ones, because I've never eaten a bad roll here! The concept of this restaurant itself is great; there aren't too many places that serve up the sushi - burger combination! The ambiance is neat, and the staff very friendly. But not everything about Cowfish is praise worthy. There are a couple negatives in addition to the long wait times. the menu is ridiculously extensive, and therefore confusing! and... the prices are kinda crazy too (specially the sushi.) The burgers & sandwiches are decently priced, but can't say the same about the sushi, appetizers or drinks. Probably not a place to go to every other week, but definitely worth visiting at least a couple times (like i said, the menu is too long, and one visit just won't be enough!)!"

You are able to get extremely close to all the animals and there are so many things to see and do.....you will not get through it in one day.  We bought a yearly pass yesterday and had so much fun that we came back today.....and we still have not gone to all the exhibits! (But we do have a 2 and 3 year old so we move a bit slower than those without little ones.)  The petting zoo is fun and conveniently located right next to a large playground.  The kiddos had a great time taking a break from walking and playing on the equipment while my husband and I got a chance to sit down and have a break too!  Be sure to have plenty of quarters so you can feed the giraffes, kangaroos, and various other animals.  They will walk right up to you, it's so fun!  The aquarium is AWESOME!  There is even a place to feed and pet the stingrays.  I'm looking forward to riding the water roller coaster this summer.  (There is also a couple of train rides, a sky tram, and casserole that range in price from  $2.50-$5.00 per person---kids 2 and under are free).  I would highly recommend this zoo to anyone....and to get the yearly pass.....it's by far worth the money and it even includes 2 free adult passes!  ***The food is of course highly priced and not healthy so I brought in my own snacks and water bottles for my kiddos.  Instead of spending the cash on food you can use it for rides! Last year my parents took my oldest child to this zoo and went to Dillon's restaurant.  They were very impressed with the food as well as the cost.  They have a great happy hour and always run coupons in the paper so I'm excited to try this out on our next visit!"

Being at the bar allows you to receive great recs on unique dishes (i.e. snapper nigiri with special hot sauce, et al).For me, what sets Nobu apart is the freshness of the fish, and the perfect cut of fish paired with the perfect amount of rice. It's all about getting that balance right.In regards to vibes, Nobu is a place to be seen and the interior supports the Asian influence with contemporary.Be prepared for a long wait if you don't make reservations and remember, there's a premium to be paid for the Nobu brand and quality."

At no more than $2 for a plate  and each plate having 2-6 pieces you can get a full meal in for cheap.They have a few good rolls like the Haiwian roll and the salmon lover (I think that was the name). The seaweed salad isn't bad either. What is nice is that if something isn't coming by on the belt here you can always order it from your server, but they have a pretty good selection on the belt.The fish quality isn't the highest here but it also isn't horrible or going to make you sick, just don't try to compare it to that of Roka Akor or Nobu. If you are having a sushi craving or just want a cheap sushi meal it will be satisfying.I think the best part is that you can eat until you are full here and still get out for under $20. My only addition to that is that if you are really starving then some of the $20 all you can eat places around town may end up saving you a couple bucks.

The one knock on the different plates costing different amounts is some plates aren't 100% clear what color they are so you may under estimate a bit, but it's max a $1 difference per plate.I have gone to the Teharu in Scottsdale and Tempe and my advice is to go at times that are a bit busier as they will have more selection on the belts and the odds it was freshly made is higher than at off peak times. That really goes for any conveyor style sushi place though.Overall I like Teharu as a low cost sushi craving filler, it's not the pinacle of fine sushi experiences but it's a fun and tasty stop."

I can get a 750ml bottle of Johnny Walker Black label for $19 sometimes, that's about half as most other places.Twelve packs of beer (good stuff, like Dundee honey brew and Moosehead Lager) for ten bucks. Tequila, and I mean good tequila, for about $20 a bottle. Kegs, boxes of premixed martinis, oh, and wine. My wife and I bought all the wine for our wedding here, they even give you a discount if you buy by the case.I never walk out of there for less than $100, and that's only because I find so much good stuff. I always try to grab something new and interesting when I walk through the aisles. I am sometimes caught by sample stations giving our samples of wine or beer and it's so good (and priced well) that I typically grab some of that too.My latest discovery is TY-KU, an Asian spirit which tastes something like Sake, Melon liqueur, and Green Tea. It's only $20 for a large bottle and the bottle has a very pretty light in the bottom that illuminates the green deliciousness when it sits on your shelf. It's fantastic over ice.I've been going here for two years now and there are only TWO things EVER that I have asked for and was not there, hard root beer, and mexican bottled coca cola. That's it. And I've asked for some pretty obscure things...so that ain't bad at all. They have a really nice Cigar selection too if you're into that kind of thing.Anyway, enough of my rambling.

Occasionally, it would be nice to have Schooner at a doggie day care place closer to my office, for those evenings when I want to plan things with friends who have dog-friendly homes. However, finding a good place in central Phoenix is proving to be impossible! I went to a private place one day, but her back yard was so chock full of potted plants (including cactus) I was afraid Schooner would get into something. Villa la Paws and Tailwinds both charge a ridiculous $10 fee for a temperment test. And they won't believe me when I say Schooner has a wonderful temperment because other people have lied (so apparently I'm being dishonest too...grrrrrrr).My last review was December of 2010. Now, a year and a half later, I STILL LOVE ME MY GILBERT DOGS!!! Stephen and his crew have doggie day care down to a science! They have a well-behaved pack (where the humans ARE the pack leaders and the dogs know their place...most of the time). Schooner still LOVES going there. All I really need to do is pull up out front, open the car door while Doug (or someone) opens the door to Gilbert Dogs, and he'd run right in...and he has some separation anxiety issues so that's saying something. He runs and plays and naps and eats and hangs out with the big dogs (because when this 14 pound Jack Russell Terrier looks in the mirror, he sees a MUCH bigger dog...but without the ""little man complex"" unless he runs into a bully dog and he will stand up for himself). So Stephen, can you maybe look for a location in central Phoenix. I think you're quality and style of dog day care is sorely lacking from the central Phoenix area. It's time for PHOENIX DOGS!!!! :-)"

For some reason, paying LESS for a movie means they should have MORE privelages, such as sitting directly in front of you when every other seat in the place is empty.But, rude and noisy patrons aside, and ignoring the fact that you have to see Michael Pollack's ugly mug every other slide during the pre-show ads, this is a great place to go see a movie. You pay about a third of what you would pay at a regular theatre, and they tend to get movies a lot faster than discount theatres used to. Whereas it used to take 9 months for a flick to hit the discount theatre, it now takes 3 or 4. Right now (late October) you can see movies that came out in July and later.

Just a tip, either accept eating with your hands, or remember that silverware is BYO.The veggie platters come with about six dishes, always one or two lentils, a split pea (yellow), some kind of green, often either cabbage or beets, a salad (seasoned with a vinagrette, sometimes spicy, sometimes not), sometimes green beans, and one or two other legume based things that are usually unidentifiable and delicious.  I love Ethiopian dishes, they are so warm, savory, and spicy - with complex flavors (I wouldn't even know where to start to imitate it at home), and the tangy, yeasty injera (spongy crepe-like bread) rocks my world.  My favorites on the veggie platter are always lentils, split peas, anything involving the cooked cabbage (often coupled with potatoes and carrots), greens (sometimes collards, sometimes others, generally finely chopped and stewed until delicious), and anything involving beets (also generally coupled with potatoes).  You don't get a choice for what comes on the veggie platter, just whatever they happen to be cooking up in the kitchen that day.  I don't think I've ever eaten the same meal twice.Expect the food to be plentiful and diverse, and the service to be friendly and slow (don't expect to be in and out of there in under an hour, and expect to have to ask for your check, and then maybe take it to the front to pay).  If you're even a slightly adventurous eater, like a lot of flavor to your meal and bang for your buck, Merkato should be on your ""to do"" list."

Although this is a strongman man gym, they are very open to anyone looking to get an intense workout. Come in ready to bust your ass.I fell in love with this small, 3,000 sq. ft. gym after my very first workout. They have everything from light to heavy free weights, tires, sleds, traditional weights, sledges, etc. Most people that come in here are either strongman competitors, professional firefighters(Scott, the owner, is a PFDFirefighter and Arizona Strongman), or just people looking to push themselves in a gym with just the necessities and none of the frills.They offer small lockers, a bathroom, towels, but not much else. This, in my opinion, is great for really getting down to business. It's no Lifetime Fitness where there are tvs and other meaningless distractions to detract  you from a good workout, so don't expect to be pampered. The staff is very friendly, they are all in great shape and are there for the love of it. The membership rates are awesome as well, as it is month to month and no contracts.All in all, if you want to push yourself, whether it be heavier weights or better results, I would recommend this place 100%. I have never trained with Scott, but from watching him train other people, I have no doubt in my mind he will push you to your limits, and you will be grateful. Oh, and by the way, mind your manners and use your common sense here. Be respectful of the gym(come in ready to get down or get out), be mindful of others, and for God's sake, re-rack your weights and clean up after yourself! Not only will you lose your gym privileges, but you will have to pay a reinstatement fee to come back. This is no joke! Pick up after yourself, we are not your mothers.I will try and post a picture of all the gym rules, they are quite humorous, but they are there for a reason!"

Its an amazing speakeasy meets cirque meets absinth concept, and definitely is a social experiment. I took advantage of the show special they advertised on Living Social and I took my sister her for her birthday. There are two shows that they do. The LATE show is supposedly MORE PROVOCATIVE  and the EARLY show isn't provocative but definitely has those SEXUAL INNUENDOS. I would like to see the late show just to see the difference.At the show I was very impressed. Super interactive and very engaging with the audience. The show is also very intimate. The audience gets a very close look at the show so you can never really get a bad seat. Just think, they're passing audiences popcorn, giving you shower curtains during splash zone, or pieces of chocolate. I mean..it was LEGIT. The acts aren't boring at all. The hook of the show is pretty cool and definitely works for the place. My favorite acts:BONE BALANCING GODDESSDANCE DUETCONTORTIONISTOther acts I saw that was ""ok"":MAGIC TRICK (even though I got picked to go up.) You can't TRICK me into liking the magic trick just because a cute dog is in it! (like my pun?) I think being picked to help with the trick killed it for me ONLY because I was snooping around trying to figure out the trick.MAN IN TUB: Aerial straps. Ok it is pretty cool and sexy, but after you see the Atherton Twins from Zarkana do the aerial straps, it's kind of like no matter how wet he is, he still doesn't fly as high...WALKING THE BORDER: same as above.We went to the show and stayed later to watch more mini acts at the bar, in which we ended up staying for a good 4 hours. We ordered that TERRARIUM thing. It's very pretty AND cool, but at some point eating flowers isn't that great anymore. :( But I did love eating the dirt which is a mixture of choco mousse, brownies, cake, and what tastes like Ferrero Rocher. I'd buy this for someone if it's a special occassion (because they put a candle in it), but not worth the $35. Invest in on the caviar tacos.The cappuccino is also probably the best cap I've ever tasted. Extra dry and foamy. Bold and full. Perfect night cap (that's a pun too).==here is a good tip==People get confused if you HAVE to watch the show to experience the experiment. NO YOU DON'T. You can eat there, or have drinks, or just watch the show. You don't HAVE to do all three. To watch the show you do have to walk into the bar and wait around until show time (so you can choose to go early or stay later after the show see more).They do small mini shows throughout the place like every 15 minutes. So it's like watching a smaller version of the actual paid show. So, if you only plan on drinking or eating and not watching the show, just go up to the hostess and tell her. Left side is for dining and right side is for the bar/show."

Total success!  Though the Yelp page said ""no"" under good for kids when we checked, it totally was.  They asked if we wanted a high chair (yes) and the waiter was brilliant about getting something to eat out fast for my nephew.  He dug the butter parmesan spaghetti noodles (not on the menu, but suggested by our waiter)!As others suggested, I had the beet salad with goat cheese.  Spot on!  A well done dish.  I also enjoyed my main, the butternut squash risotto.  I also highly recommend the roasted olives - my first time ever having hot olives, and it worked splendidly!Roast banana and chocolate gelato scoops make a nice combo to finish it all off.  I'd have loved to try one of the signature cocktails, but didn't happen tonight.The ambience was kinda hip and noisy enough to make having a kid with you ok, but not too noisy to make it uncomfortable.  No reservations accepted, and they claimed a 15 minute wait, but we were seated within 5.The only thing keeping them from a 5 star was some slight errors on the waiter's part, like bringing fries only instead of fries and a caesar salad as ordered, or forgetting a spoon or enough boxes for the (ample) leftovers.

I would have to say that I enjoy it about as much as a Carl's Jr Famous Star.  I did not like the fries the first time I had them, but they have since grown on me. I would have to say that one good thing about In 'n out burger is that you can order it any way you want and they always get it right.  You really can tell the freshness of the food, without a doubt.  The only bad thing is the wait.  If you go when it's busy, you will definitely have to wait about 2 to 3 minutes longer than most other places but they make up for it in quality.

The food was good, but I'll just go down a quick list of things I took notice of. First, the attire for the hostesses was very tacky for a restaurant in my opinion... Especially a classy one like this place. When we arrived for our reservation, we were sent into the bar area to aimlessly await someone to seat us. Inside this place a beautiful. We were seated in this massive booth upstairs which overlooks the downstairs seating area. The waitress arrived in a very classy/cute outfit and also had a helper which was nice.... Kind of like having two people wait on you.We were served a variety of complimentary breads to start things off. All of them were wonderful and done very well. I almost felt like asking for seconds.Our waitress presented us with a custom made cart which was arranged with all the different cuts of beef they serve. We chose to stick with the tried and very true Bone-in Ribeye (med rare), a loaded baked potato side, asparagus and to start the meal... A French onion soup. The French onion soup was delicious. I couldn't exactly taste the cheese and there wasn't a crunchy top layer.. But the soup flavors were great and this probably falls into my top two onion soups... The first being Papillon in Fremont Ca. If Gordon Ramsay gave this more of a gooey cheesy top layer with fried bits.. It may beat the best (so far in my experience at least).The steak arrived pre-cut and perfectly cooked. I don't get the pre-cut... But it didn't bother me and still tasted amazing. Aged to perfection and had great marbleization. Juicy, tender and thick. I like to gnaw on my ribeye bones so I went to town on that too. A good steak doesn't need anything to compliment it. Just meat and a perfect caramelization.The loaded baked is large but wasn't done the best. It came with a sort of country gravy which I didn't care for. No chives, no sour creme and I don't think it even had cheese... But I may be wrong. The worst part for me was that the outside wasn't salty and crunchy how I enjoy my baked potatoes. If I knew this, I would have opted for a different side.The asparagus was perfectly cooked... But lacked much flavor besides the flavor of asparagus... Which is fine if that's all you really want. I like mine with a roasted/grill flavor or at least some garlic and seasonings, so that would have been nice.Of course our meal wasn't complete without a dessert. we ordered the Coconut Cake which had pineapple and passion fruit-guava sorbet. This dish was very nicely done! Light, flavorful, not too sweet and unique. I definitely recommend trying it.Overall our experience was good. The ambiance was nice, the food was good, the steak was even better and I would not hesitate at spending $150 for another steak dinner here at Gordon Ramsays Steak."

I'd avoided Centurion for awhile after a couple of visits in which I was burned by the fact that they didn't carry menu items during normal business hours.  Tonight, no such problem.I actually took a friend here after seeing that they'd revamped their menu with a tilt towards tapas.  It used to be they would carry full sized pizzas and a select number of elaborate (and expensive) dinners.  Now the pizzas, the salads, veggie dishes, and pretty much everything else is done tapas style.  This worked out perfectly for us as we were able to split 6 dishes (and drinks) for about $50 including tip.  We shared the chefs risotto (tonight it was a black pepper and cheese), the chef's boulianese with andouille sausage, a small pizza (with sausage, cheddar & grape jelly), and of course the pancetta wrapped gnocchi.  We also got some free seasoned leeks to start and shared a cheese puff pastry with a chocolate mole sauce for dessert.  All of the dishes oozed creativity and the gnocchi and risotto dishes were to die for.  Chef Eric made the right move going the tapas route as it gives his customers a great chance to sample a larger array of his creative dishes.  Some of them might be a little exotic for most, but all of them have a kaleidoscope of flavors both big and small.So I'm happy to say I can once again recommend Centurion as a Downtown Phoenix destination.  Chef Eric is a tremendous talent who seemingly has no fear of trying new flavor combinations no one else would think of.  Some creations are better than others, but with a cheaper tapas style menu now available, his creativity is now easily accessible for the masses."

I was intrigued when I heard it was another place to watch a good show, but it definitely became a priority when I heard that Chris Bianco (owner of Pizzeria Bianco) and Doug Robson (owner of Gallo Blanco) were in charge of the restaurant on the other side of the door.During my first visit, we were there to support a band and only had time for chips and guac (yum), but the rest of the food looked great! I will make sure I get there with plenty of time to spare before our next trip to Crescent so i can enjoy more of what their kitchen has to offer.As far as a music venue goes, I was impressed. Great sound, and juuuust small enough to feel intimate, but big enough to accommodate a good amount of people. Bleacher seats in the back are a nice reward for people that are early to their  show."

They have more specific items such as salmon tuna & shrimp sushi and cucumber rolls.Their assortments of meat goes beyond expectations.

This bar, and especially its $7.50 Happy Hour (Sun-Thu, 5-7pm), is a hidden gem.Bar menu is an elaborately researched, leather-bound history of American cocktails, rendered in an unfortunate cursive font that's hard to read, but give it a chance and you'll learn a lot. The cocktails are all handcrafted with exquisite attention to detail. I enjoyed talking booze with our friendly mixologist, and could easily have ordered each and every classic on the menu, but crab legs were waiting for me at the buffet.Clover Club (gin, lemon juice, raspberry syrup, and egg white): a knockout.Vieux Carre (whiskey, cognac, bitters, Benedictine): also great, strong. Tasted: Mai Tai (a souped up version of the classic): killer, tartHemingway Daiquiri (rum, lime & grapefruit juices, maraschino liqueur): not at all the sweet daiquiri you'd expect, very smooth.Alas, it's trapped in the Monte Carlo. HIT appears to be carved out of half the High Limit Lounge (never seen so many cameras hovering over a bar before), and while the sofas and bar feel luxe, the blah view of the gaming area reminds you that you're not at Cosmopolitan or Mandarin's sexier bars.

I went there this past weekend and was so happy to finally head to this beautiful eatery that has a breezy island vibe with sprawling patios both at the front of the house and back.It's no wonder the spot was bustling when I went for dinner at 9 p.m. on a Friday night -- the mixed crowd of all ages packed the house, which had cozy booths and striking printed curtains that make guests feel right at home, no matter the crowd. The bar contained a few televisions with sporting events on, so you could dine in any type of atmosphere you wanted -- cozy dining room, spacious patio or at the bar.Our servers were professional and attentive, and the meal was fantastic and hugely portioned -- I took half of mine home. I loved the Lucy's ""Spiked"" Lemonade ($8) cocktail I got, with vodka, lemonade and fresh rosemary. It was refreshing and strong and didn't have a gross alcohol taste -- it was easy to drink and tasty.We started with the Guacamole and Chips ($10), which is pretty much a must-try since all the ingredients, including the chips and salsa, are all made in-house. The salsa had the perfect amount of spiciness (maybe a 7 out of 10), and the guacamole would have been great to eat on its own.For my meal, I tried the Shangri-La Vegetarian Burger ($12), which consisted of grains, nuts and seeds. I usually don't get French fries, but I did this time, and they had really great seasoning and the perfect amount of oil. The burger was tasty, but the consistency made it difficult to hold together. Not that it matters -- it was a great veggie burger that was really filling.Chelsea's biggest impression on me was the service of the staff, who made you feel welcome and valued from start to finish. It's no wonder people remain so loyal to the eatery -- it seems like a wonderful place for anyone to have a great meal."

I loved the decor of the place.  The buffet was A+++.  We tried both the bfast buffet and the dinner buffet and both were excellent!  Such a great variety and the quality of food was great for a buffet.  They also have ""all you can drink"" (wine and beer) but the buffet will keep you full.  They have a bakery/coffee place called Baby Cakes with super yummy treats.  I took some pasteries with me when we checked out.  The pool was deserted since we went during off season, it was a little chilly but it looked like a nice place to cool off during those hot Vegas days.  They're were a good amount of table games and fun slot machines.  The prices were right as well on the rooms and the gaming.  Low limits!!!  Overall I liked the M.  The room was spacious and the bathroom was great as well.  I liked the layout.  It was a little ways away from the strip but we enjoyed our stay."

This was one of my all-time favorite dining experiences.  You have to be prepared for the format - rather than sitting at a table with a waiter, you sit a the ""bar"" surrounding the kitchen.  You get up-close-and-personal with your chefs, your sommelier, and your server.  It is simply amazing to watch the chefs prepare the meals.  Unfortunately we'd purchased show tickets; otherwise I could have stayed at L'Atelier for another 2 hours mesmerized by the kitchen and the plates they output.  The food was OUTSTANDING, and the presentation is impeccable.  We went early (6:15) to get to a show, so my husband got the $59 3-course meal, and I ordered off the menu.  Both of us were overwhelmed with how good our choices were, and I can't say enough about the panna cotta w/ strawberries and white chocolate marshmallows.

My wife and I ate there for breakfast two days in a row, not counting stopping in for a snack (best ice cream sandwiches EVER...see below), and for cookies at their express place in the casino.The breakfast sandwiches are first class.  My favorite was the Salmon Croque Monsieur...delicately smooth, smoked salmon and cream cheese between luxuriously buttered pieces of bread.  Very rich, but very delicious.Another favorite mentioned in reviews regularly, was the almond croissant.  We had it both at room temp and toasted.  I liked hot, my wife liked it better not.  It was really a tremendous pastry either way...ask for it how you like it!Our favorite items there were the ice cream sandwiches...At $5 a pop, we had $20 worth in one sitting.  I know that sounds gluttonous, and maybe it was...but they came in 4 flavors and we weren't leaving without trying them all...and it was money well spent.The magic is that these are two French macarons, about 4-5 inches long, with boldly flavored, creamy textured ice cream in between.

We were looking for breakfast after a morning hike and this seemed to get some pretty good reviews.  Really fun little find.  It's not quite a coffee shop, but not its not quite a restaurant, and its not quite a wine bar.  The menu isn't very expansive, but what they do have they do pretty well.For breakfast I got their croissant sandwich with egg, bacon, and cheese in a baked croissant.  Also couldn't resist trying one of their blueberry muffins.  And decided to wash it down with a nutella hot chocolate.  The croissant sandwich was fresh, simple and delicious.  The nutella hot chocolate was awesome and perfect on a cool fall morning.  The muffin was actually a little disappointing as it tasted a little dry.  My girlfriend got their New Mexico Burrito as well as a nutella mocha.  And they also had a brie and apple turnover in the pastry display so she got one of those.  She loved the mocha nutella and the brie and apple turnover was an awesome combo of flavors.  The burrito was scorching hot, but good and the salsa was a nice accompaniment.As mentioned, its pretty small.  You order from the counter when you walk in and they bring your food to you.  There's a small seating area inside as well as a nice patio outside.  We sat at the outside high table area which looks down on the patio tables.  The atmosphere is very casual but has a modern feel that attracts locals from the neighborhood and hipsters alike.  And the outdoor patio is dog friendly (at least three couples we saw were taking advantage of this today.Overall prices are right and the atmosphere is super relaxed.  Total cost for the two nutella drinks, two pastries, burrito, and croissant sandwich was $23.  Food wasn't perfect and the selection was minimal, but we'd definitely come back to sample more of their menu."

I had the rice and beans on the side along with sauteed cabbage and plantains. i took it to go and went back to my classroom to eat my lunch. I have to say that I am a lover of caribbean food as well as a lover of Indian food as well. Number one, the portion of food she gave me was HUGE!! Number two, the food was FANTASTIC!! The chick peas and potatoes were tender and mildly spiced.  The sauteed cabbage was fantastic, a little salty and very tender. The plantains were tender and cooked perfectly. The portion of rice and beans was huge and they tasted very good. The rice was tender and not over cooked and the beans were just done enough. I have to admit I finished 95% of it because it was so good and I did not want to stop eating it. If you want great caribbean food in a clean and not fancy atmosphere, this is the place to try!

I liked the decor and set up of the place and having the pool in the middle with blackjack tables in the back is okay, but I resisted the temptations of playing. Overall I would give this place a solid 4.8 rating. After we were done popping bottles some of us stayed behind and bought drinks at the bar in the back, they had 2 bartenders serving like 30 people that were waiting, so it took forever.

A vegetarian arepa (the La Del Gato) with cheese, plantains and avocado was also pretty tasty, although it could have used more plantains and less avocado for balance and flavor. The fresh cheese is out of this world, though. I will definitely be going back. It sounds like this place is doing well, too -- the guy working the counter said he was still cleaning up after a massive lunch rush when I got there just before 2."

I'd wandered by after a race and was looking for a calm activity that would stretch my legs. And this choice turned out to be perfect.The Gardens are a mix of several different trails, each with a different theme: these range from a trail based on lifestyles of the ancient Sonoran Desert dwellers to a path based on desert wildflowers. Each path is a mixture of different desert plants mixed with educational exhibits. Highlighting the flowers are various sun-seared rock formations and distant mountains.It's a very easy trail which is well marked; you won't get lost in the desert. A visit around sunset is also worth considering: the mix of light and shadows adds an extra dimension to the surroundings. The outer trails do close after sunset, although the inner path (The Desert Discovery Loop Trail) is lighted and remains open.They do rent this facility out and I think it would be wonderful for catered events, weddings and the like. The Gardens definitely are a jewel for the Phoenix area."

I was not disappointed, I ordered a salad that was pretty good. I was more excited about the apple fritter I ended my meal with, I was elated by how wonderful it was. I rarely eat baked desserts anymore as it is difficult to find ones that are not only safe for me to eat but that actually have good texture and taste good. Many people think to make up for the missing gluten by adding excessive sugar and it reunions the dessert. Jewels fritter was perfect, not to sweet and wonderful fluffy texture. I will definitely be back to try more of there meal items, as well as more baked desserts! So glad to have found a place that is catered towards people with gluten allegies and is in my area of town!"

And let me be honest, the Oceans Eleven movie and fountains had a huge part in me wanting to stay here.  So my mom and I stayed for 6 nights, in a room high up overlooking the fountains.  First off, the view is absolutely amazing.  Watching the fountains anytime I wanted out the window was a major highlight.  The room itself (2 double beds) was nice and clean and well-maintained.  The bathroom had a very nice shower and tub, and was very spacious.  The TV was mounted on the wall, and great to view from both beds.  The hotel cleaning staff was great - they will come in anytime (from afternoon to evening) - which I thought was pretty nice.  Sometimes they would leave chocolate on our bed stand, but not consistently.  Within the hotel, my only complaint was there isn't a Starbucks - but honestly they have a coffee/pastry shop that does the shop in a pinch (just very expensive!!!).  The staff overall is extremely nice and goes out of their way to take care of you.  The casino is kept very clean, and the hotel restaurants are good (ate at the cafe, Prime, and the buffet for breakfast).  I would say this is a hotel for classy adults who don't like the loud/crazy/modern atmospheres of some of the other hotels.The only sort of negative (which really isn't even a big deal) is that check in time is late, so if you arrive early you are not going to get into your room anytime soon.  However, they will kindly store your luggage and bring it up to your room promptly.  If you stay here, you are within walking distance of Aria, Cosmopolitan, PH, Caesars, Paris, and probably more - but my mom and I are not walkers (and it was 100 out!) so we taxi'd most places.  This hotel is also nice because you never have to wait for taxi's like at other hotels (there is always one waiting!).  Finally, if you like high-end shopping, it's wonderful to have stores like Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton, etc. in the hotel!  I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

The waiter suggested us to have a coffee at the cafe next door until our table was ready (about 30-40 min wait at 11am).

The bread was amazing. The soup was ok. A tad too thin and salty. The best part was they served it with more bread. The brownies was really yummy. It was super fudgey and the salted caramel was tasty. I love the ambiance of the bakery. The vintage french vibe was cool. I would come back here again if I was in NoDa.

Our search ended with ATL Wings!! We have been ordering wings from ATL for about a year now and have enjoyed every delicious wing. We have tried several of their recipes and our favorites are the Garlic Parm, the ATL style and the Sweet & Tangy. My hubby has always ordered his wings ""naked""  with sauce on the side because he ""likes to taste the chicken, not just the sauce"", until he tried my wings from ATL. The wings are always perfectly cooked, nice and crispy. And for people like my hubby, the dry rub flavors are a perfect choice! While we have never dined-in, when placing our order the service over the phone is always pleasant and helpful and when picking up our order the service in person is more of the same. The place is small and isn't easily found as it is in a very small strip mall.

It's almost too convenient that they own that bar.  Again, nice atmosphere at the bar, it feels like you are in someone's house.  And I liked that they were able to tell us there that our table was ready and that we could bring our drinks over to the restaurant.We were seated within exactly an hour.  We ordered the Rosa and a Magherita with garlic.  Very good but not life changing.  Our waiter seemed to think that his job was finished once he brought the pizza.

They offer free hour-long guided tours of the facility at 11.00 AM and 2 pm. So it's reasonable to plan your visit so that you are there just in time for either of these. The tours are guided in a very friendly manner by one of the retired but still very dedicated staff members and they can grant you a 10% discount if you buy something in the library shop after the tour.It's a well stocked store and I found nice, relevant to the library, souvenirs to bring home back to Russia--large and small format calendars featuring a variety of paintings under the title THE READING WOMAN.The fact that one of the participants of our tour was on a wheelchair pulled by her husband attests to the wheelchair accessibility of the building, which is itself a masterpiece of architecture.I'd also advise to plan some time to browse the library on your own after the tour. As to catering I only found a small snack bar ( run by a welcoming gye ) in the entrance hall. For those willing to lunch on something more substantial one of the options is Bryant Park behind the library.The LUNCH EXHIBITION that the library was operating at the time of my visit very soon made feel like I would do with a hearty meal."

We were taking our kids to Taliesin West to visit and we needed a place for lunch that was vegetarian friendly as I am a veg and my wife is mostly veg. Our kids are 100% still carnivores so we needed a place to satisfy all needs. I searched for a vegetarian restaurant near where we were and Kitchen 18 came up!  I decided to try it and it was definitely worth the short ride to Scottsdale/Shea. We are not Jewish and do not follow Kosher laws. We are faithful Christians that try to eat higher quality and organic  foods as much as possible. I have not eaten at a Kosher restaurant since moving to AZ 8 years ago from New Jersey. I have always appreciated the quality and higher standards of Kosher food, so I knew this place would be good. Boy, I was 100% right in that assumption. The food was excellent and the service was superb! We started with the hummus/babaganoush plate to share and it was excellent. The baba was the best I have ever had and it was so happy that it did not contain yogurt as so many of them do. Being Kosher, the dairy is not allowed to be served in the same restaurant or even prepared in the same kitchen. I do not consume animal products at all, so this was awesome! The pita wedges were homemade, fluffy and delicious! The hummus was mild tasting but creamy and wonderful. Plus it came with black olives and Israeli pickles. For the meal, my wife ordered the carrot soup and the grilled veggies platter. I did not try the soup but she said it was very fresh and delicious. The grilled veggies were seasoned nicely, smoky and satisfying. I had the veggie pita sandwich that came with a mound of sweet potato fries and a side of rice (basmati) with grilled mushrooms. The sandwich was made with the same homemade pita and it was fantastic! The rice was cooked well but needed a little more salt, but otherwise was great. The kids had the Kitchen 18 burger which was a grass-fed beef patty on a wonderful Challah roll served with a mound of french fries. My son was a little upset that he could not order bacon and cheese on his burger, but I think he survived just fine. ;). The burger looked well made and was cooked perfectly to order. The fries looked fresh cut and were cooked well. The staff was friendly and attentive to our needs without being overbearing. Our drinks were brought out quickly and the timing of the meal was perfect. Granted it was a slow Tuesday afternoon, but I am sure the service is good all the time. We did not have room for dessert but wanted to try the carrot cake or the chocolate cake. Maybe another time! We do not get over to Scottsdale that often as we live on the west side of town but will 100% consider Kitchen 18 again. Back on the east coast (and before I was vegan) I ate at quite a few Kosher restaurants and delis in my past and Kitchen 18 is as good or better than any of them. I look forward to going back and trying the falafel wrap and having more of the delicious pita and hummus. Shalom. L'hitraot. Toda."

I have been dreaming about you.  Your yogurt parfait is so delectable, that I have visions of swimming in giant pools of your yogurt, rolling around in your homemade granola, and getting drizzled with your orange-blossom honey.  Hmmm. On second thought, that seems a bit sticky.  Perhaps I'd better just return for another weekend brunch.To be fair, the Herb Box was not our original destination.  We intended to go to another spot... and spied a never-ending line.  Who wants to wait for breakfast when they have a hungry 4-year-old in tow? Not me!  We ventured onwards, and stumbled upon the Herb Box.  No wait?!  On a Saturday morning at 10?  I was a little skeptical that there must be a reason for the slow morning, but hunger won out and we took our seats.  Our table ordered the amazing yogurt parfait, the BLT, and the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes.  Though they were out of their fresh squeezed oj (juicer malfunction?), they were thoughtful and grabbed a bottle of Naked juice from their market for us.  The BLT was something else... crispy pancetta, ricotta, fried egg, arugula, seriously delicious tomatoes, and a spicy aioli, all sandwiched between some of the freshest bread I've ever eaten.  It was just slightly toasted, and all kinds of delicious.  I love when restaurants take a generally boring sandwich and breathe new life into it.  Well done, Herb Box.  The outdoor patio is beautiful and perfect in this Spring weather, so make sure you venture over before it gets too hot out."

It's a small place, located in the strip mall in front of Wal-Mart. You order at the counter, they take your name and give you a glass for your drink, and then they call your name when your order is ready.I ordered the smothered sandwich and a drink for under $10, with a side of potato salad. The food came out fast, and there was plenty of it for lunch. The potato salad was served in a styrofoam container next to the sandwich, which was packed with plenty of pork and cole slaw. I was a big fan of the cole slaw.The food was good, but it wasn't great. It's what I'd expect from a strip-mall barbecue place. I didn't taste much smoke. It doesn't taste like authentic Carolina barbecue to me at all. Still, it's plenty of food and a tasty meal with plenty of tangy sauces to choose from. It's on par with other chain-style barbecue restaurants in the area -  not knock-my-socks-off awesome, but solid and tasty.I recommend this place for families or couples looking for a low-key meal at a decent price.

The bartender hooked it up with the alcohol. He made it really strong. Is it worth the $15.00?? Some might say no and others might say yes. I personally kept my souvenir Eiffel Tower Cup. When you're in Vegas, most everything is going to cost something, so why not spend $15.00 on a drink that equates to probably 4 - 8 oz margaritas? If you bought just one margarita in Vegas, it would roughly cost about $8.00 or so. I think it's worth it!! Plus it was deliciously made and had a lot of alcohol!!"

We'd heard about it through excellent reviews in the New Times and the Republic (a positive review in the Republic is often a neon sign that says ""stay away,"" but we decided to risk it). As a transplanted New Yorker/San Franciscan/Los Angeleno, I have to say Tokyo Lobby has been my favorite sushi experience in the valley. If you're used to Ra or any of the other McSushi places, it's worth the schlep up to North Glendale (which is almost as far as the Yukon from where we live) to check this place out.T.L. is a small, 10 table joint, but it's crowded in a vibrant, fun way. Service is fast and friendly. It's in a strip mall, but if you keep your eyes left of center as you approach from the parking lot, you won't see the WalMart on your right. The usual/traditional suspects are brilliant -- stunning unagi, maguro, tobiko, etc. The sides and appetizers were fab, too: great seaweed salad and gyoza. Tokyo Lobby is creative with the specialty rolls -- the Marilyn Mon-Roll (not kidding) was terrific: a spicy tuna roll wrapped in albacore with an elegant topping of crispy/crunchy onion.There's also a full menu of earthbound flesh and assorted other goodies. Everything looked great. Really -- check this place out!"

I went with a Groupon, which was very clutch and turned a slightly high-ish price into a very good deal for what it is. The Chihuli glass exhibits are truly stunning, and the garden is full of cool-looking cacti and other desert plants. I was fortunate enough to visit in mid-April when all the cacti were in bloom and that was really pretty to see as well, with all the flowers everywhere. We also got to see a roadrunner which was EPIC! Got a great photo of it before it scurried off too!It is VERY hot and there is some shade in various spots but not much. However, they did plant water fountains EVERYWHERE which was very essential. We refilled our water bottles probably at least a dozen times in the roughly 2 hours we spent in the garden. There are maps and stuff, but even for someone who is very very directionally sound, the garden layout was mildly confusing to me. At times, I was confused about whether I had missed a portion of the garden or if I was doubling back the way I came, or going down a dead end. The garden could benefit from some better/clearer signage. All-in-all this was a really good experience and I'm glad we went. I'd probably go back if I were ever there in Winter, or late evening when the weather is cooler."

We scored a slice of pepperoni/sausage and one of Sicilian (the latter was a bit burnt on the crust bottom) :( The meat-topped pie was thin, cheesy, chewy, tasty. The Sicilian pie was nice - cheesy and crusty and perfectly sauced. We also picked up a small order of the garlic knots. Real doughy goodness with plenty of garlic sensibility. The accompanying marinara made them extra tasty. Wasn't so much a fan of seeing them served swimming in a greasy bath. Still very tasty.We also scored some cannoli. These amazing pastries are VERY recommended. Smooth cream with chocolate chips and a crispy crust and pounded with a powdered sugar storm. Whoa.I liked this place.

Or pancakes. Or whatever they're called. They're a cross between a crepe and a pancake with a little dash of heaven thrown in. You can get them in different flavors, I believe, but they're just as good plain. If it's your first time in, that's probably what you should get, if you're having trouble deciding. Round out the meal with some bacon, eggs and coffee and you're good to go.The second time I went in, I tried the corned beef hash and eggs. Man are they good! They give you a generous portion and you'd better bring an empty stomach because you'll need room to put it all away. Folks, this is diner food at its finest. Why go to Denny's when you can eat locally?The decor inside is kitschy and old school. Lots of black and white photos, memorabilia and tchotchkes of a bygone era line the walls and give you something to look at and talk about while your stomach growls in anticipation.Just be warned, weekends are crazy, busy and crowded, and parking is at a premium.

We decided to do it tapas/family style and share between ourselves.Here's what we got: Tomato Soup: 5/5 stars. It wasn't too hot and wasn't too cold, just right. The bowl it comes out in makes the presentation great.Wedge Blue Cheese Salad : 4/5 stars. It was sooo good, except there was a lot of blue cheese on it. Once you take some of that off it was nearly perfect.Brussel Sprouts: 5/5 stars. This is one of my favorite dishes. The flavors are indescribable. There is so much flavor yet there doesn't seem to be anything overbearing. Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets: 5/5 stars. Read about these bad boys in a recent article in a Vegas magazine, had to try them again! SOOOO GOOD! Don't be afraid of the name, they are to die for. Cooked to a tee and the inside makes 'em that much better. Love me some pot pie nuggets.Dates: 4/5 stars. I'm not much of a date person, but I have to admit they were pretty stinkin' good. They were wrapped in bacon and rumor has it the dates are from Tivoli Date trees....interesting. I'm not a wine drinker but my best friend said her choice of wine was awesome.

I think we were served by the owner/co-owner and she was extremely attentive during a busy Saturday night.The food was delish, and we had enough leftovers of course, for another meal. One thing I would recommend to them is to have more noodle dishes, and few people know what ""bean thread"" noodles are, so it would be good to use other descriptors like ""clear rice noodles"", etc. Also, at other places, when I've ordered stuffed Hmong chicken wings, the sauce accompaniment has been fish sauce with lime juice, so this was a variation upon that classic."

Yeah yeah, I'm breaking my own rule that no place that serves everyday food should get more than 4 stars but the extra star is to keep this place going so I can come back for lunch over and over.  The tacos are excellent...not as big as a ""Los Tacos"" taco but very tasty.  Definitely an artisan concept as other reviewers say.  Everything we tried was complex in ingredients and flavor (as much as you can pack into a street taco sized portion).  Our table tried out almost all the tacos on the menu and there was an overall preference for the various pork tacos but they were all good.Service was fantastic but we need to go back to re-review as traffic was light today and it seemed all the staff was focused on a few tables.  Hope more people start going so they can continue to do well.  Definitely looking to go back after work to try all the beers....oh yeah...the tomatillo salsa was the best I've had in a while."

Alright, back to the original review.)Being from San Diego as well, taco shops are hard to like in Phoenix.  This one isn't.  We went there because of Guy Fieri.  But the carnitas is why we go back...4 times since November.  And we live in Queen Creek.  It's a taco shop.  Taco shop = street food, not fast food.  Street tacos are small.  Thankfully, so is the price.  $1.25 each.  That means I walk out full with authentic Mexican food cravings satiated for $5.  My wife's favorite - carne asada and carnitas tacos.  While the carne asada is good to great, the carnitas is excellent.  Both have the typical onion/cilantro accouterments with red hot sauce added..  The carne asada has tasty guacamole added also.  I'd prefer they leave the sauce off and give me the option.  They have a green sauce also.  Both are delicious.  The carnitas burrito is what I want, though.  First time I ordered it I asked for no beans (a burrito with beans is a strike against them) and got a flour tortilla packed with melty, juicy, glorious carnitas meat.  If you're looking for pure, concentrated, braised pork flavor get the burrito sans beans.  Other notables:  the chili relleno, the sopa (topped with any meat you'd like.  We, of course, tried the carnitas).  I waffled between 4 and 5 stars because of the aforementioned bean faux pas, and their signature burrito, the Bombero, just didn't cut it for us( consider this a 4.5 star review?).  The sauce was a hybrid between enchilada and american barbecue sauce.  Weird.  But the insides were still great.  Try them."

I have been to little crown on spring mt a few times, and never had a bad experience. A couple buddies and me sat at the bar and the bartender came over and informed us that sunday was 1$ PBR night. Well I was looking forward to a Stella or a Bass, but dam, 1 dollar pbr. So I had a couple of those, we also had some of the homemade potato chips and an order of wings.  The potato chips were really thin and broke easily in the curry which could of had a little more flavor.  The wings were decent, kind of your average bar wings. I'd have to give a low rating on the food, but honestly we only tried those two things and nothing off their traditional menu. I will definitely be back to try those becuase the bartender was really nice. He got our orders right, engaged in a bit of small talk, was able to answer questions I had about their happy hour and offered a sample of Bombadier when I asked what kind of beer it was, having never seen it before. The decor is pretty standard, pictures and UK beer decals. They have a little cove for darts and what sounded like a billards table upstairs. They have a board with all their sports offerings, and special events like karaoke and trivia.  So I will definitely be back for some pints, hopefully of something better next time, but cmon 1 dollar is 1 dollar, amirite?"

Very open layout, with strange seating/table arrangement.  But the space is so large that you can still have an intimate experience.Had the 4 course menu starting w/ the foie gras custard brulee, which I thought was interesting, but also not the best use of foie gras.  I'd rather just have a lobe of it plopped down on my plate.  Delicious nonetheless.Followed that with the Scallops over a bed of braised ox-tail.  I thought the combination was strange as the ox-tail was so strong.  Individually, each were cooked perfectly, but it just didn't work for me as a whole.And for the main was the Iberico Pork Loin, which was recommended by the waitress.  Pretty disappointed by this one, and I'm Chinese!  We love our pork, but this really didn't hit the spot.  The pork itself was a bit dry and was cooked to medium/medium-well, whereas I usually prefer mine closer to med. rare.  Aside from that, the dish as a whole was solid, but nothing I'd recommend.Had a taste of my friend's skirt steak and it was much better.Finished with the Carrot Cake, which I loved.  It was a bit crispier on the outside and very light on the inside.  When people recommend carrot cake to me, I tend to find what they like is a bit too cakey and moist/oily, and too heavy on the frosting.  The cream cheese ice cream was a much better companion than standard frosting.I think I had a few more complaints than a standard 4 star review, but I can see the potential here for a very solid meal."

From the reviews I had read, I knew the restaurant was about more than just sushi, and I was really impressed by the sight of the kitchen staff building a charcoal fire in the open kitchen (flames, sparks and the whole nine). The invite literature mentioned ""prime cuts of lamb and beef steak grilled over a charcoal flame"" so everyone in my party was looking forward to trying those proteins ""Robata style"".Cold sake while I wait at the bar for my peeps to assemble? Right on. We were all seated at the comfortable and impressive sushi bar with a clear view of the chefs at work at their stations. Say hello to a bowl of edamame, everybody! Various things were being grilled, sliced, prepared with steam, stacked into ceramic vessels with rocks and shells and ice and other garnishes. No plate left a chef's hands without being visually attractive. I thought the abalone mushroom could have passed for actual abalone, and with the way it was sliced and grilled, you could fool a good portion of the public into believing that it's some sort of seafood. Especially when it's garnished with pea-sized salmon eggs. One of my group is not such a great fan of foods that once swam, so he was disappointed in the salmon eggs, salmon tataki and the diver scallops we were offered. The scallops were on the rare side, and one of us (not me) remarked that they were a lil too gooey inside for her. I didn't mind, because they were grilled and seared on the outside and dabbed with a lil bit of wasabi-lime-green apple sauce.  There were small cubes of pork belly that were juicy and fatty and grilled perfectly with just the right amount of char on them to enhance the natural flavors of what is essentially uncured bacon. Powerful tasty.Niman Ranch Strip Loin came my way sliced and looking a perfect medium rare. It was seasoned with a little sea salt and had a robust beef flavor and a buttery texture. I could have eaten another small plate of it, easy, and if I had really wanted to, no-seafood dude is also well-done dude so his steak was available because it wasn't done enough for him.I was not a huge fan of the Duck Confit and Foie Gras Rice Hotpot with Perigord Truffle. In my humble opinion it did not stand up to the previous courses. It looked and tasted a bit like a hash I might make with a leftover skin-on chicken thigh and some sticky rice. It was definitely made with upscale ingredients (truffles and foie gras) but it didn't taste decadent enough to match the description.  Perhaps the most talked about and enjoyed item were Brussels Sprouts. Described as ""Crispy Brussels Sprouts with Japanese Mustard"", they were phenomenal. The sprouts were quick fried to a crispy brown on the outside and Japanese Mustard needs to be a standard condiment everywhere.The dessert course was an ""Orange Blossom Honey Chawanmushi w/ Strawberry & Lime Foam"". All you need to know about that is in the name, and that Chawanmushi is an egg custard and sorta like soft-serve ice cream.I tried a Latour Chardonnay and a South African Pinotage with dinner and I'm now a fan of both.  Service was impeccable. Their staff should train everyone else how to present and remove and refill. I enjoyed letting the chefs at Roka Akor take over and the rest of my group did as well. Except for that one guy who doesn't like seafood or anything less than well done steak. He had to stop for a hot dog at a gas station on his way home."

After only a few hours post-op, I was able to see road signs and my clock from my bed, which were things I could never do before. The next morning, I went in and the eye exam revealed that I had gone from 20/600 (-5 in both eyes, one which had astigmatism) to 20/20!   Initially, they gave us a 10% discount, but I had received an email about procedures being 20% off over the summer, so I asked them for an adjustment. The amount for the entire procedure ended up being around $3,500. A friend of mine flew to Korea for her procedure and paid $1,400 for her flight and another $1,800 for her IFS LASIK procedure, but if I were to do it all over again, I would choose to go back to the LASIK Vision Institute in a heartbeat. My husband was really pushing me toward PRK, but I chose LASIK because I did not have the recovery time (they said it would be 2-3 weeks vs a few days) and still, if I were to do it all over again, I would choose LASIK. I had minimal discomfort and dryness and I opted not to pay for the permanent punctal plugs. I used the prescribed eye drops, which cost me $80 at Walmart, quite liberally. I will say that they cause a strange metallic aftertaste that is appalling, so be forewarned.  I was concerned with the blurring in one eye that kept coming and going, but I have read that it is normal. I also had some ruptured blood vessels from surgery, which are now gone. Surprisingly, I've had minimal dryness compared to what I was expecting. You know, like having dry eyes while wearing contacts. Even the Acuvue Oasys brand contacts would cause great discomfort. An optometrist basically told me I shouldn't wear contacts at all because my blood vessels were growing toward my corneas, so glasses were the only option for me. I'm in my early 30's and I don't know why I didn't have LASIK sooner. Also, the halos they warned about don't seem any different from what I experienced with glasses. I'm thrilled. My husband says that there is a glow about me and honestly, I feel liberated. No more smudged glasses or crooked glasses, worrying about getting them knocked off of my face, or fumbling for them upon waking up.My only gripe with this facility is that they scheduled a bunch of us for ""surgery"" at 9AM. The receptionists seemed to spend more time in the back of the office than the front. I waited until 2PM. The procedure itself lasted only 15 minutes. As we sat, nervously waiting in a dark room in our ridiculous garb (a hair net and some shoe covers), we were reassured that all we needed to do was stare at a light during the procedure. Dr, Kownacki performed the procedure and again, repeated that all I needed to do was stare at the light. The procedure itself is indescribable and there was slight pressure due to the suction and speculum. He must have done a fantastic job because during my post op, the person who examined my eyes said he could barely tell that the procedure had been performed. I know there are a lot of horror stories out there. I read a ton of reviews before deciding to go through with the procedure. The consent forms I signed at the office also caused my stomach to churn. However, nothing in life is without risk. Do your research, ask questions, and negotiate the price of your procedure. I wish you the best of luck in your decision-making process!"

You should know that I hate saunas - longest time in a sauna ever was about 30 seconds. But I love a good masochistic workout, so I really wanted to try this.First of all, about the facility. I have done yoga in many studios and love my classes at the YMCA in Ahwatukee. This yoga studio is so so beautiful! The space is open, inviting, relaxing, and extremely clean. The hot room has ceiling fans, and when it gets too warm, the instructor opens the doors to let cool air in. Even with all the bodies in the room, there was NO stinkiness!! This was always my biggest fear about hot yoga. I wore capri yoga pants and a yoga top. I brought a full length towel, huge bottle of water and a yoga mat. The instructor placed me close to the door in case I needed to cool down. The class pace was perfect - flowing from one pose to the next. There was wonderful non-new-agemusic playing on a great sound system the whole time. The posture instructions were clear and easy to follow, however, I think it would be difficult for a beginner. It could be that the instructor knew there were no beginners, and therefore, didn't go slow. I had to stop three times towards the end of the class. I was too hot and my heart was beating too fast. After a three minute break (still in the room) and some water, I could finish with the class. My mat, clothes and towel were completely wet - I'm not talking damp - I mean WET. I highly recommend bringing an extra change of clothes for after class  and wearing as little clothing as respectably possible in the class!The class costs $16 for an individual session, or $20 for two classes (two weeks in a row). They have a ton of different class purchase plans available with varying discount levels, depending on how many sessions you purchase.

Nowhere in between.I usually come here every week on Sunday morning to get at that all-you-can-eat brunch for ~$20! The food can be hit or miss at times, but the staples of crispy bacon, fried eggs and fresh mimosa never cease to amaze! Sunday brunches showcase some of this place's creativity because certain menu items (the specials, quiches and desserts) constantly change with the week and season. The food overall is just alright, but if you don't want to cook and need a lot of choice (indecisive), this is the place for you. During the week, I come here regularly to pick up my dinner because it's close by and my workday is long. They have a great corporate menu that lets you have a $20 (tax included) dinner that comes with entree, salad and two sides. Your choice is grilled chicken, steak, or salmon with sides of fries, mashed potatoes, green beans, or spinach (can't remember the rest). I will admit, for the most part the taste is rich and delicious, but their execution is so inconsistent. Occasionally the salmon is undercooked, or the chicken charred on one side, or the mashed potatoes liquidy. And once I recieved my food 50 minutes after ordering... but more often than not, I am pleased with the efficiency and quality that I'm paying for. I would say this is a pretty sweet spot for brunch and a convenient place to grab dinner, but don't always expect it to be ""like last time.""4/5"

Now I know that TJ Maxx is filled with all kinds of hidden gems. The best day to shop and get a leg up is in the middle of the week (new shipment put out). I find if u go in on Saturday then you can find a lot of stuff marked down. I love this store, I can find something for everyone if I'm shopping for gifts (urban wear to pretty boy swag); completely decorate my house and get a new outfit (with shoes and accessories) for hitting the town.

Let me begin with my not so positive experience with Chiropractors locally...I have visited a fair share of chiropractors that claim to care about the patient or even have an extensive knowledge of the spine, the central nervous system and proper or even safe adjustment procedures. Of all that I have experienced in Las Vegas, they have fallen very short of my expectations and ultimately lost my trust. I was perpetually searching for someone who I could simply trust. I stumbled upon Dr. Quan after a series of absolutely raving reviews from friends and colleagues, so I decided to give her a shot. Her practice is incredibly welcoming and I honestly felt at home from the moment that I walked through the doors. Unlike other doctors that I have encountered, she seeks to heal from the inside out and inquires about overall health concerns and will explain, in terms that anyone can comprehend, how she will work to help heal you. I came to her with complaints of low energy and focus, lower back pain, digestive issues, among others, and she very professionally explained techniques to she would utilize to get me feeling my healthy usual self again! I appreciate her approach as she analyzes your overall health and targets areas witht the goal of significantly improving your entire wellbeing. She has made lifestyle change recommendations, which have supplemented my treatments administered by Dr. Quan and resulted in an improvement in my quality of life in just a few short months! Also unlike other chiropractors, she will not come across as a business owner first, and a medical doctor and healer second. My experiences with other chiropractors who simply attempted to sell a package and recommended a ""one size fits all"" series of adjustments forced me to develop a level of distrust within the medical field. Dr. Quan eased my concern and allowed me to trust once again. She is genuinely there for you. I highly recommend visiting Dr. Quan if you are ready to have a truly life changing experience and have a strong desire to improve your quality of life. Be sure to say hello to Tom, the welcoming and fun to talk to office manager, on your next visit!!"

I went here with miss Dottsy Z for our girls date night and omg this place is fantastic! I have been here one other time 6 years ago on a blind date and had forgotten just how good the food was. We started off with the ever popular Burrata, which is- fresh mozzarella with a creamy heart topped with a balsamic glaze served with black label prosciutto crudo and toasted bread. From what I understand it is goats milk cheese that is flown in fresh daily and they have limited quantities. To say this is like butter is an understatement. It was delicious!!!!! Next I ordered the Rustica which is mozzarella, topped with prosciutto crudo and arugula after pizza is cooked. It took everything in me not to eat the entire damn pizza. Dottsy ordered the Prosciutto Crudo which is similar except hers has red sauce and no arugula. My goodness. I am still shaking my head and kicking myself for giving Dottsy all the leftovers. What in the world was I thinking? I will be back again very soon and not wait 6 years for another visit."

Customer service is always great here. There are always enough cash registers open. I like this place but am not as price sensitive as some people."

Really - it had so much chili, salsa, etc, that I barely tasted the egg!  Plus for some, negative for others perhaps?  I liked it but also wouldn't have minded a little less ""stuff"" in the omelet.Hubby and mother-in-law both loved their food.  We all shared a cinnamon roll and OH-MY-GOSH was it delicious!  I pretty much let them have a taste then devoured the rest of it myself.  If you go here, you MUST get the cinnamon roll.  The cream cheese frosting is unbelievable.

My experience was phenomenal and I can't wait to return. I've had many piercings done at several shops throughout Arizona, this was by far one of the best experiences. Rob (Shop Owner/Piercer) was very inviting from the moment I walked in the door. He is very knowledgable and informative, he definitely knows what he's doing. The shop: It's fairly new, but I already like the direction they are going with their decor. They have custom art from local artists that you have to check out! Very clean, you can tell they pride themselves in keeping the shop sterile. They also have mints for their guests. Winning!The jewelry: Absolutely beautiful! You can tell it's high quality, which I love! Yes, the jewelry is more expensive than most shops, but you get what you pay for. I've learned this the hard way at other shops and don't care to make that mistake again. I'm happy to know that this shop uses only the best.The piercing process: The moment I sat down I was at ease. Rob was kind enough to talk me through his piercing process as well as make me laugh. I felt safe knowing I was getting pierced by a professional. All together everything went very smooth. I didn't cry, so that's a plus. :)If I could give this review 10 stars I would. Unfortunately, Yelp has star limitations. Thank you Rob for making my birthday wonderful and special! I will be returning soon for a new fancy clicker for my septum."

We'd just flown into town and were looking forward to an easy gastropub dinner. The place was not at all what we expected. It was less gastropub than full-on upscale sit-down restaurant, with entrees creeping into the $30 range. Thankfully, we ended up loving the place.Citizen Public House is in cozy Old Town Scottsdale, and it was vibrant and charming on a Friday night. We had a late reservation (9:15) and the place was still pretty busy. I liked the atmosphere--it was nice, but informal. We hadn't seen Stef in four years, and had a great time catching up over dinner. Service was excellent. Our waiter Brad was on top of his game.We had a couple rounds of drinks, and I really enjoyed the cocktails. The Im-Port was particularly good, a smokey drink made with Jameson, Tawny Port, tobacco bitters, and Guinness foam, served on the rocks with a smoked sugar rim. The Thai Margarita was pleasant, too, a mix of Patron silver with galangal and kaffir lime simple syrup, tamarind reduction, Thai chili sea salt, basil, and lime, served on the rocks. It tasted more like a straight margarita than I thought it would, but I liked it. I also had a sample of the barrel-aged Craftsman, made with Jameson, Cocchi Americano, and Charbay green tea apertif. (Brad brought it over because I was waffling between the Im-Port and the Craftsman, and he gave me a free taste after I'd already decided on the Im-Port.) It was pretty great, smooth and boozy with a definite sweetness. Probably would've gotten it if I wanted a third drink. Matt tried one of the other barrel-aged cocktails, the Boulvardier [sic?] made with Maker's 46 bourbon, Campari, and sweet vermouth. Another solid drink.The food was fantastic. The three of us shared the pork belly pastrami and an order of Bernie's mac 'n cheese, which worked as both appetizer and side. The pork belly pastrami seems to be Citizen Public House's signature dish, and it's a great one. Pork belly came pastrami-cured and spiced, with rye spaetzle, brussels sprout sauerkraut, and mustard jus. The pork was juicy, fatty, and intensely flavorful, and I loved all of the sides. It wouldn't be right to come here without trying this dish. The mac 'n cheese was also delicious, made with curly cavatappi pasta in a gorgonzola and emmental cheese sauce, with a chilled tomato relish on top. The pasta was cooked al dente and I loved the sharp cheeses and the spicy tomato relish. The portion was huge. We split it three ways and still had leftovers.I had the pan-seared scallops for my entree, while Matt and Stef had the fair trade short ribs. Both were excellent. The scallops were plump and beautifully cooked, served with Hampshire belly bacon, roasted corn grits, wilted snow pea greens, and a cola gastrique. There was so much great flavor and texture on this plate. It was exactly what I wanted. The short ribs were another winner, a giant plate of tender coffee-rubbed ribs with dried cherry BBQ sauce, roasted parsnip puree, and seasonal vegetables.We ended up spending more than we meant to at Citizen Public House, but we were on vacation and had a truly lovely meal. I'd recommend this place for a nice dinner out in Scottsdale, to locals and tourists alike."

I bought stuff for my apartment here.  I bought gifts here.  I spend way too much time here wandering up each and every aisle waiting for the perfect thing to jump out at me.  If you've never been to a big lots, picture a Wal-Mart, squeezed down into a space not much larger than a Walgreen's.  Food, games, toys, crafts, kitchenware, cards, candles, frames, linens - all the departments are there - just much smaller.  And you could have a different grouping of stuff there every time you go - theoretically at least.  Some brands feel like they are always there, but it's hard to know which ones unless you've been going for quite a while.  To me, Big Lots is like a sport.  The competition is how good a deal you can get.  If you're willing to take a sticky bottle, dented can, or sometimes just an old label - it can be amazing."

First of all it's amazing that it's a tent. Well it's a tent from the outside but inside it just looks like a 1920s Parisian showroom. It's fantastic. I get the vibe they're going for but I have to tell you because of this very specific vibe the chairs are rickety old folding chairs and they are rely uncomfortable so be forewarned before you go in. Also they are zip tied together so there is no space. The seating could be a lot better. Because of the way it's set up your on the same level as the people in front of you so you're looking at their giant heads in your way while you're trying to see the action in the center. With that said the rest of the show is absolutely fantastic.  It opens with an acrobat who balances on about 1 million chairs and then you're introduced to the green fairy of absinthe.  She's beautiful and has a beautiful voice and you get to see a lot of her body throughout the show. Then you meet the gazillion air and his assistant and they are hilarious. Be ready for racist sexist jokes.   Also be ready if You are nerdy white black Asian gay lesbian you will become the butt of his jokes but it's funny. The amazing acrobatic acts are fantastic. You would think maybe a little clichÌ© for Vegas but not. They have totally different acts and I've seen all the Cirque du Soleil's this is different!!

And second, I ordered a very disappointing salad.  Although, it's not all my fault.  I was part of a party for two and the two-person tables were like lined up side by side so I could practically see what the people on either side of me were eating -- I'm sorry.  but for the price we paid to eat there, we could've gotten a little more real estate.  I thought that was just bad taste on whoever designed the place.  And the service was just slightly above average.  Still, the food!  The food was delicious. From the amuse bouche of watermelon gazpacho to the smores desserts, I was completely giggling and enjoying my meal.  I'm hoping my next go 'round will ensure a 5-star rating."

Then get some delicious food when you get where ever you landed. Clearly, my most recent ex wasn't significant enough to take me across the country, but I did get to Pittsburgh before I felt better (about a 2 hour drive from AK-Rowdy). Lucky I did too, because James Street Gastropub was... pardon my yankee.... fucking fantastic.Now. If restaurants were like men, this restaurant would be tall, sturdily built, a southern accent, a wicked smile, and a really big.....menu.I had the pipe bombs (flank steak, jalapenos, and did you say Guinness sauce?!), the spinach salad, the buttermilk fried chicken with grits and greens, and creme brulee to fully heal my poor broken heart.Pipe bombs were fantastic and wicked. I wish they had given me more, but, well, ya know, I still had a salad coming and a meal...and dessert. The wonton wrapper was super crispy and the oil they were fried in was clearly fresh. I'll admit to sticking my fingers in the Guinness steak sauce. Normally, salads are kind of a 'meh' affair. Just a way to make you feel better about ordering fried chicken. But this salad was seriously good. The roasted strawberry vinaigrette was a surprise, a very pleasant one.I'm going to tell you something top secret. One of my best friends knows her fried chicken and, up until this point, made the best fried chicken I've ever had, but....come a little closer, I'm not saying this above a whisper....theirs is better. I didn't know what to expect with chicken breast, it usually comes out a bit too dry for my tastes, mostly because it's severely overcooked, but theirs was perfect. Seriously moist with a crunchy, flavorful crust that stuck to the breast instead of flaking off. And cheese grits with greens....slap yo momma good (I don't have a clue where I picked up that phrase. I'm a Texan, and that is not a part of our vernacular.... Though, if you really want to be particular, neither is the word 'vernacular'). Okay. The creme brulee was good. Solid dessert made right. But what I really wanted at the end of that meal was a slice of peach pie. Or sweet potato pie. Preferably peach, but I'll take what I can get.Service-wise, our waiter was kick ass. I should have written this review when I went almost two months ago now....because I can't remember his name. It was a J-name I think, and he had to spell it because I'm a total derp when it comes to names. Anyways, he was a complete sweetheart and kept the glasses full and even made a fresh pot of coffee for me when I asked for a cup even though I told him not to worry about it. (HAH! Read someone else's review, the gentleman in question is Jarrett!)"

Their soondubujigae (tofu soup) is awesome! I asked if it was spicy since it did not have a chili pepper sign next to it and they said they could make it spicy for me. I also really love their kimchee fried rice! Huge portions!Their AYCE is very delicious! I like that they have a mix of korean and even hawaiian style things. Their garlic shrimp is very tasty and addicting! The price is very affordable at $13.99. AYCE is kind of hard when its busy just because it starts to get slow with the food coming out. One time it was busy and the guy just told us we can just order what we wanted (usually a 2 plate max at a time). Thus, we didn't have to wait everytime we were done to order and get our food.They also have shave ice! You can add condensed milk or ice cream to your shave ice! mmm!!"

All the food was awesome.  Only complaint was the mash the PB&J (pork belly & jam) was OFF THE CHAIN!!! I'm picky about my pork belly and although skeptical about this combo I was delighted.The  short rib Tostadas were also scrumptious.  My only complaint is the potato puree it sits on.  I love the added flavor but it makes for a messy handling.  I'd love it dolloped on top instead.  The tacos were flawless.The prices seemed fair. Drink selection great.    I'd rather a little more focus on the the drink menu, seems a power struggle between wine, beer, and cocktails... but since the competition is light  it makes sense here.The  service was perfect also.  Our bartender forgot to order the guac & chips, We reminded her and told her not to worry since we were full on the rest. She took the initiative to tell management and they brought it out for us at the end of our meal in a to-go bag.  INITIATIVE goes a long way.  Service is below par in the Valley, all it takes is a little initiative to change that.Very happy!!!!  Can't wait to go for brunch next time I'm back in town."

Each time I've been here I've been greeted pleasantly by both the owner and staff. My first visit, the staff was in the middle of changing shifts and my food took a little longer than usual. The owner recognized this without me saying anything and brought a free dessert. She even stopped by up make sure I enjoyed everything. My second visit the store was actually closed, but both the staff and owner were more than willing to still take my order. The owner even wiped our table off before I ate because she noticed the recent storm had blown dust on the table just minutes beforehand.

We always stock up on the breads here. My hubby loves the butter white bread. Cut it into thick pieces and just toast. Yum!

(I do wish they had more selection of breads cuz I think they do them so well!)The desserts - I like the flan, the earl grey cake, and pretty much all of them. I can't remember. We've tried so many. I like to experiment ;)And the mixed sandwich. Nice and refreshing on a warm/hot day. A good snack to satiate the hunger.Try the sukiyaki beef sandwich. Don't forget to ask to toast the bread. SOOO good! I prefer the beef over the chicken. It's juicier. And the cakes! If you've never ordered a cake here, it's a must! For your next special occasion! The whipped cream is not too heavy and sweet, the cake in general is airy and light and perfect on the sweetness (meaning not too sweet like most desserts you eat these days). Filled with different fruits depending on what you order. Just get one and see for urself!A few years ago we ordered a cake and then bunch of different cakes and asked them to cut it into little pieces as desserts/cake for our wedding guests. Everyone LOVED it! (I know... shame on me for not posting till now, but hey, I'm fairly new to yelp ;) ) We love the service here."

I knew of a couple Korean places in the area, but this place came in at the top of the review filter.  I had wanted to stop by here in the evening and check out the bar portion of ""barstaurant"".  That will still happen, I'm sure.Great menu.  Nice selection of options, except for my colleague, who prefers chicken over beef.  No chicken on this menu!  I'm fine with that.The roasted barley water, was a nice refreshing palate cleanser.  The side dishes were wonderful.  I personally like my kimchi much spicier, but it was  good balance for those less masochistic eaters.  The bibimbap was awesome!  Lots of fresh veggies, and wonderfully tender marinated beef!  I was only slightly disappointed with the fried egg over medium.  I wonder if they would crack it raw into the pot, or do sunny side up.  I will definitely ask next time.  Cooking the yolk into my hot rice is my favorite part of the dish!I was a little surprised that there was only one other table occupied at lunch.  No complaints.  Was a very relaxing little lunch getaway.  The waitress was super friendly and helpful.  The atmosphere is hip and the little touches like small tin bowls for your drink, and a trash canister on the table, set it apart just enough to make it a memorable experience.I'm looking forward to a happy hour or dinner time visit, with a larger party.

I saw several other menu items that I wanted, but I'm avoiding carbs.I'd gladly come back if I were at the Tuscany again.It was kinda funny because just as we were leaving, the Beverly Hillbillies showed up for a wedding dinner.

The scallops came highly recommended and were delicious, especially with the salted caramel reduction. It's pretty hard to go wrong with scallops though. The octopus salad and yellowtail crudo were both delicious and light, just what I needed.

We'd originally planned on the new Burger Meats Bun, but they had no tables for two for another 40 minutes which was too late for us. We scoured the other options locally when aha! Bangkok Bar!We both love Thai food but tend to cook it at home rather than eat it out. Part of the reason is that Thai always seems to be that bit more expensive than other cuisines, and that is certainly true of Bangkok Bar's downstairs sister Port of Siam. Luckily, for the more cost-conscious amongst us, BB offers a more affordable option. Yes, the portions are smaller, but they taste just as good and would be, I'd imagine, perfect for lunchtime. Kip had pad thai, I had green curry (they ask you just how spicy you want it, mine was a perfect medium) and then we shared a sort of Thai spring roll. It was all delicious and I'm keen to return and try more of the menu.Now, I say it's more affordable, but it's still around the å£7-9 mark for fairly small portions and I'll admit to being glad we'd ordered the spring rolls too as I was hungry. But for good quality Thai food I don't mind too much.I wish we'd had time to try the cocktails, as as well as a selection of classics they had a menu with a Thai twist - goodness me they sounded delicious! And reasonably priced.Atmosphere wise, BB is small with bar seating and a limited number of tables. It's also quite busy, this is no romantic candlelight dinner for two. Vibe wise, think a smaller Bar Soba maybe? But better."

Often the houses are spread a little further apart and require driving and parking a couple times in order to catch all the houses.

We never had to wait more than a few minutes for a trolley to stop by and the air conditioned transport was a welcome bonus!It's always a blast to see what people have done to either restore or modernize these classic homes and we always walk out with opinions - some good some not so good! But it's evident that those who are generous enough to open their homes to parades of strangers are proud of what they've done and should be commended for their generosity and hospitality.

While Ichiza might offer a crowded and loud experience out of the corner of Tokyo, I-Naba would be a gentle breath of Kyoto.Upon the invitation of a friend of mine, I joined her for lunch at the newly established restaurant that I had heard NOTHING about, specializing in Soba noodles, which I had only enjoyed in yakisoba.  Headed by one of the prime chefs from Bellagio's famous Picasso restaurant, there is nothing like this restaurant's offering currently in Vegas - no Soba houses to speak of - but thankfully, this restaurant really, really delivers.Graceful lines and floral arrangements grace the interior.  Service is attentive and friendly, helpful to answer any questions about the presentation or function of the ladle, spicing the broth to enjoy your very healthy, buckwheat soba, etc.  Service was a little slow on the refills of my water and tea, but the food came out quickly, hot, and gorgeously presented.  While the noodles were of course, delicious and I enjoyed being able to flavor my broth myself, I was just beside myself with the appetizers, which chef really shone.  The calamari-stuffed vegetable tempura was the standout in the midst of some excellent dishes, along with fresh, flavourful sushi whose presentation was only matched by the floral arrangements.  I could have equally been happy ordering several appetizers versus an actual entree.  When one ventures into a space such as I-Naba, they're really not just looking for quality food so much as an experience in an unfamiliar realm of cuisine - but the ceremony and care of food from top to bottom was just wonderful and I look forward to returning again."

The reviews for Intermezzo were great, so my expectations were high. I met 2 friends here on one of those uncharacteristically warm, still technically winter, Charlotte days, just to give you an idea of the perfection I had ingrained in my mind. Intermezzo did NOT disappoint. It met my high standards, and then some. As I waited for my friends to arrive, I caught a whiff of, what I believe was the Garlic Braided Twist appetizer. Must try them next time. They smelled UNREAL. We began with the antipasto plate and Portobello Mushroom Tower. They were both great! I loved the assortment of meats and cheeses, and the goat cheese on the Mushroom Tower was so creamy and just, perfect really. Next time, I will ask for a bread basket. I ordered the Sarma (Cabbage Rolls) as my entree. With all of the amazing sounding Serbian dishes on the menu, I figured, do as the Serbians do! I may as well have licked my plate. One friend ordered a pizza. She raved! I was too busy wolfing down Sarma and my other friend's food to get a bite. The other dish I tried was the Blackened Chicken Pasta. The menu's description doesn't sound that enticing, but I was in chili powder heaven. It was subtly spicy, smoky, creamy, rich...

First of all, if you know this place is going to be small I wouldn't suggest bringing large groups. Everytime I've been here was with only one other person when I've had a craving for good ramen and some Japanese beer. With that said I've always been able to get a seat without having to wait too long and my food has always come out speedy, fresh, and fantastic. The tonkatsu-shoyu ramen is awesome and if you'd rather opt out of the mixed broth they are both good stand alone too.

The rooms are modern and very nice, with LCD TV and upscale materials.  Got to watch out for the snack bar.  They charged me for something I didn't take.  Took a while to clear that up.Location is not as central - next nice casino is about 10~15 minutes walking distance away.I like the pool the most - it's 3 pools in line connected by a narrow 'stream', so you can swim straight for a long time.  They have free, iced bottled waters.The buffet here is excellect - better than Bellagio's (similar food variety, much better quality)As for the casino: I like the slots.  As some have mentioned, the table minimums are very high.  You can find the cheaper $40 tables, but those maybe the ones with the machine card sorters, which I don't like.   Someone on the craps table was playing with about $1/2 million worth of chips - rows of white $5000 chips!?Just saw Kobe Bryant there."

Being Vegas, they allow you to shoot any rifles, pistols, ars and etc! Ammos are also not a problem!! They got two sides for you; one for pistols and the other one for rifles which is awesome cause the rifle side it's farther distances for the targets! Come prepared for alot of walking back and forth cause you need to manually change out your target sheets. They have a cooling period which all people are ordered to cease fire and not go near the table so that new shooters and people who need to change their target can have a chance to change it. They have several people who are the range masters who can help you out just in case you need help. :-D they also got go-carts to get your ass if you are on the rifle side just cause your ass walks too slow there and back which holds up other people hehe. Make sure you are well equipped before coming here as you will need all that you can. The prices are decent and you can practically spend the whole day or half day here for the same price. I love this shooting range and it's not crazily pricy as the indoor shooting range where they go by the hour just because you bring your own gun. But over all it's worth it! Plus you get to walk off whatever you ate in Vegas XD admit it we all need to exercise so why not do it when we are enjoying ourselves!"

Usually it becomes sensitive and grows back into your cheek.  My protrusion was not all that sensitive, and I kept biting it.  It kept growing out and I needed it removed.  This requires minor dental surgery.  That was all I knew. **End aside.**  I didn't know the cost, what the surgery would entail, nada. The waiting room seems to be about an average size and includes a fish tank.  The rest of the office includes a vast array of rooms.  I had a quick preliminary examine by Dr. Fish.  By the way, I was expecting a woman, but obviously Leslie is also a male name.  He gave me the diagnosis and treatment plan.  Next, I was ushered into another room and was told the price and the surgery was scheduled.  The price varied by the anesthetic.  I opted for the cheapest option, local anesthetic only.  Adding laughing gas was an extra charge, which means you are still awake, but a little loopy.  The third option was to be entirely knocked out.  In addition, the protrusion that was cut out of my mouth was sent to a lab for analysis to determine whether it was benign or malignant.  This was an extra charge, and I still don't know what the cost will be.  I arrived for my appoint still a little unsure of what was going to happen.  I had scheduled it for 7 AM on a Monday morning.  There seem to be set times for surgeries and set times for examinations.  By the time I was shown to my room, there were ten to twelve other people in the waiting room.  I had a nurse?? take my vitals.  I was connected to a machine that takes your blood pressure every fifteen minutes or so.  I was given a topical anesthetic to get the numbness going.  Dr. Fish came by and used a pinching tool to inject the rest of the local anesthetic.  Then we waited for the numbness to take over my right cheek.  Dr. Fish came in later, asked for another nurse, and started the procedure.  I could feel some punching from tools I assumed were used to keep my cheek open for cutting.  I saw some bloody on tools, but didn't feel any cutting.  Apparently, there was a smaller protrusion starting to grow next to the main protrusion, and Dr. Fish cut that one out as well.  It took under ten minutes.  After the procedure was over, gauze was inserted into my mouth.  I bled for another three hours and had to change the gauze every half hour.  After the surgery, I was shown to the recovery area that had alcoves with beds.  One women was asleep.  I guess she took option number three.  I was given a goody bag with the extra gauze, a prescription for penicillin and a heavy duty pain killer (I think it was percocet), and a pillow case.  I was also given the talk for someone with stitches in their mouth.  No alcohol.  No mouthwash.  No solid foods for a few days, and then keep it soft, etc.  I was supposed to come back the following Monday, but was leaving for vacation on Saturday, so I came back on Friday instead.  In the end, although I didn't know what to expect, everything went very smoothly and professionally.  Despite the reviews I read on Yelp, the price was explained up front with several options.  I also had to pay for the penicillin, (I didn't need the pain killer, just used some Motrin) and the analysis of my mouth tissue.  But such things are to be expected.  I could have refused to have my mouth tissue analyzed and prayed that it wasn't malignant, but I like sleeping at night.  I wouldn't want to have oral surgery again, but if I did, I would go back to Dr. Fish."

The taste of the world was great. It's interesting to try the different drinks from different countries. They also have great portions sizes. It's enough to share a serving with 2 people.We also had the Float Variety Platter (which was OH so yummy!) The taste of the world tray offers you 16 different drinks from different countries. There are 8 drinks per tray. Also it's only $7 for the taste tray. The float platter wasn't that bad either. It was $8 for 8 different floats. ( I tasted 3 of them before I blew one out of my back end, which subsequently made my hubby go into a laughing stupor)We also were able to take pictures with the Coca cola bear.

Hostesses were nice informed us it would be a few more minutes so we got a drink at the bar, very pricey drinks but they did have my favorite bleu cheese stuffed olives. Finally seated and they did honor my request for the fountain view, such a romantic spot. Our server greeted us an older gentleman but right away we could tell he was snobby and looked down at us since we were a young couple. Just brushed him off, for a starter we had the scallops, so delicious served with baby carrots and a  puree that I can't remember but oh man so good! For dinner I had the filet while my husband had the ny strip with bone marrow, to share we also ordered asparagus, mushroom & spinach along with pommes rissolees, these fried potatoes. Everything except the potatoes was delicious!  Just melt in your mouth delicious. Steaks were cooked perfectly, we were so stuffed. i dont know why my husband ordered a warm apple strudel because our server brought us an anniversary dessert which I noted in our reservations and we were in a food coma after that.

Greeted at the door with a friendly smile, we were immediately seated at a white clothed table and attended to by Cole, a refreshingly skilled waiter.   Yes, the restaurant was 'clean'.  (if you saw the Check Please episode, you get it.)  With the tapas menu, there is so much to choose from it is difficult to whittle down the choice.  Although the wife already ate dinner, it didn't stop me from ordering the stuffed mushrooms, pancetta wrapped gnocchi and of course, if there is pizza on the menu and a wood burning oven, margherita pizza for comparison sake.  Margherita pizza has become my benchmark pizza because it is difficult to mess up with such basic ingredients -- 00 flour, water, yeast,  tomato, mozzarella , basil and a touch of olive oil.   As a waiter, Cole is on top of his game.  Probably the best service we had in a very long time from any restaurant.  Quick with drinks, recommendation, suggested order of dishes -- he was in command.   When the dishes arrived, I knew my wife would be stealing samples.  Amazing!  Delicious! The other critiques have nailed it and I cannot add anymore to which they have wrote, other than go there and you won't be disappointed in the tapas. At this point, I knew we would be back to explore the rest of the tapas dishes. As for the Margherita pizza, I recommend calling the restaurant call its Margherita pizza something else other than a Margherita pizza.  With the name Margherita Pizza,  there are established expectations (ingredients/product from a wood burning overn) as I previously wrote.   I took a bite of the flaccid, what appeared to be an undercook crust.  Sure the edges had hints of a browning crust but the crust was pale white, soft, malleable with no hints of browning/toasting which traditionally results through the use of a wood oven.  Sensing the displeasure, Cole sought to correct the pie by offering a different pizza.  I asked just to stick it the over some more.  The chef's explanation was that this particular Margherita pizza has too much moisture so it will never be crispy.   I did note the topping had a post oven addition of balsamic vinegar circle and some greens on the top; it did appear to have a lot of cheese but didn't appear to be buffalo mozzarella which could be very moist; and some tomato slices.   To their credit, she did offer take the pizza off our bill.   To my fault, I should have paid closer attention to the menu's detail ingredients of the Margherita Pizza -- which is why, I recommend they name this particular pizza something else.   Did I mention, I am a pizza snob? I do make my own homemade and love the simplicity of the certified neapolitan pizza -- why change perfection?The wine, drinks, tapas and excellent service is what we will be returning for.   I will explore the other pizzas but will seek Cole's and the chef's recommendation first. I'm  positive they have a pizza for my snobby stomach's heart."

You have the option to take out or dine in with waitress service. Dine in we did and we were greeted by the peppiest waitress I've come across in a long time.I ordered a carne asada burrito, enchilada style and with sour cream and guacamole on the side. It was excellent, and ridiculously filling. In fact, sad enough as it is, I couldn't even put it all down. And to wash all that down I had a nice sized horchata.

A year later, it seems like SushiWa is what everyone talks about if you live in the 89052 area code.  We finally gave it a try yesterday, and I was reasonably pleased. The decor inside is very modern and roomy.  Not like your typical AYCE joints in town - where you can reach over to the table next to you with your chopsticks to try out their dishes.  Their menus cover your basics but with a little more.  This AYCE actually gives you sashimi (one order per person).  That was pleasantly surprising.  We then ordered our usual sushi and rolls.  The fish is VERY fresh.  The boyfriend claims that the super white tuna there is by far the best he has had, even better than the ones in California.  I must say that the freshness of the fish is comparable to the freshness of the ones in Hong Kong, so that's saying a lot.  The sushi was made of little rice and a big chuck of fish - just the way I like them.  The rolls were somewhat difference because they were cut very thinly.  Must try the super spider roll made with soft shell crab and shrimp tempura - yummy! Their fresh oysters are also very delicious, but also one order per person - boo. Overall, I enjoyed my experience at SushiWa and will definitely return since it is so close to my house.  Another nice thing about it is that there is no wait.  AYCE sushi joints usually have at least a 30 minute wait, and it is just plain ol' obnoxious.  Aside from the thin rolls, this place lost a star because of its strict rules about how many order per person.  By the time we had our third rounds of orders, I was getting so frustrated about what we had already order or what we can't order.  But it is what it is!Oh, our server, Monica, was a sweetheart.  However, you guys must be mindful that this restaurant is owned and run by Koreans, so it is not your typical/ordinary Japanese place.  Lastly, this place plays awesome music!  Fresh fish, great service, awesome music!  You should be sold by now.  Enjoy!"

At night time, they have beautiful trees that are lit up with colorful lights- red, blue, green and my favorite color - pink! The pink trees actually were the more abundant of the colored trees. Aside from the trees, there are nice bright string lights hanging across the gorgeous buildings. There is also a giant water fountain near the marketplace. The whole place has a Medeterranian feel to it. There were several folks when we went but it was not too busy.

I'm teetering between 3 and 4 stars.  The restaurant is super cute.  The decor is neat and you'll feel like you are on a dining adventure sitting in the nifty closed off tables.  I really like the list of specials.  I love knowing that if I went back, I could dine on essentially a whole new menu.  They had lots of items on special that seem to change daily.  There were hits and misses.  The good news with eating this way is if you don't love a dish, it is only a few bites to choke down....The standouts were a tempura cheese trio with fig jam, and a grilled steak and onion sizzling platter (koro koro steak.)I quite enjoyed my cocktail - a mango soju soda.  Sweet and tasty.The rest of the food we ordered was OK - and we ordered our fair share of items.  It's definitely worth the trip for the experience of a fun exotic foodie adventure in a cute place.  In my opinion, the food left a bit to be desired and I don't see myself running back for any one dish.  I am happy we went though! No regrets.  Much like other ""tapas"" style places.  The bill reflects your gusto.  It is easy to get carried away and get smacked with a total over $50 a person.  I advise that your order slowly to minimize the sticker shock.  We exercised pretty serious restraint so we only ended up paying $130 for the 4 of us."

I asked the counter service man to check my rear brake pads because my dealer said I should change them out - their price was $400. Goodyear gave me a cost estimate of $140 + $90 for brake flush. I came in a today, a few weeks later, to get the service. They honored the price and offered a discount on top of it. Eric the manager is very personable and helpful. He was spot on with the time estimate of the service, too. I'd highly recommend this Goodyear location."

My wife and I were looking for someplace to celebrate our anniversary and wanted to try someplace we hadn't been to before.  Did a bit of research and the menu here looked pretty interesting.  We were not disappointed.  We'd made reservations and had requested the Chef's table.  It's a 6 seat bar top overlooking the Chef and his two assistants.  He spoke with us for a few minutes and explained the menu.  We arrived to catch the last half-hour of happy hour and took advantage of $5 Pineapple Kiwi Seviche and $ Shrimp Tostadas.  My wife enjoyed the Sangria that we got by checking in with Yelp.  The menu has a lot of small plates and appetizers.  We tried the Fire and Ice Seviche with lump Crab and the BBQ Duck Mac-n-Cheese to start with.  The seviche came in individual sized spoons for easy sharing since each bite contained a frozen concoction to tame the fire.  The Mac-n-cheese was a huge portion with fantastic flavors, we shared it and still had enough to bring home (we forgot it on the bar).  Next we tried the Asian Tuna Tartare and the Jimmy Roll.  Both were fantastic dishes and made fresh before our eyes.  We finished off with the Chocolate Flourless Cake and the Tropical Tres Leches Cake.  The service was great, all the waitstaff worked as a team to make sure all of the orders were delivered even if it wasn't to one of their tables.  We're definitely going to be heading back here.  We didn't try any of the awesome looking tacos or any of the entrÌ©es.  Top notch meal and we got out for about $100!"

I'm not often a fan of chains, but Texas de Brazil won us over.The salad bar is a meal in itself. I love the Italian meats and cheeses. The couscous was excellent and a nice palatte cleanser. The asparagus provides a healthy dose of greens. Everything looked fresh and appetizing. I'll have to sample more items next visit.At the table, the sides of mashed potatoes, fried bananas and cheesy bread bites are tasty as well. They help dull the saltiness once the meat parade begins.We wasted no time and let the feast get underway. Since it was our first visit we sampled a bite of every offering. Once we found our favorites; we stuffed ourselves silly on lamb chops, leg of lamb, parmesan crusted pork loin and medium rare filet. All were the perfect temperature, well seasoned and tender. If only I could travel with a second stomach! Instead, we had to call it quits before the meat sweats left us comatose. We are such gluttons, we chose the chocolate layer and carrot cake for dessert. Both were large portions easily shared; moist and delicious, but the chocolate layer cake was the better dessert. The dark chocolate layer is so decadent and it's the perfectly sweet end to the meatacular evening.Dress in your fat pants and bask in gloriousness of being a carnivore."

It's a quaint little neighborhood place. I'd give it one more star if it were a little larger, less cramped, more private. But the food can have four to five stars most of the time. We've been going here a few times a year since it opened a long time ago (can't remember how long; we've lived near by for 22 years).I love their veggie pizza. Their pasta dishes are wonderful, and come to think of it, just the smell of the place is a pleasant trip to Italy. Salads can be sparse (I like a salad with lots and lots of veggies and no iceberg lettuce, thank-you...), but everything else is great. Prices are reasonable. Waiters are family folks.

They have  heaters and an outdoor fireplace so its great regardless of the weather and your body temperature. If you are more into watching NFL Sunday  and staying away from nature, the indoors is small but fully equipped with flat screens showing the major games and scores. Although I only visited the Vig for brunch, I was pretty happy with their overall menu, food quality and service. The $5 Mimosa/Bloody Mary brunch special is pretty decent but some of their more signature, full-priced cocktails (like the van goh vodka with coffee and milk) definitely needs to kick it up a couple notches and stop skimping on the good ingredients (read:booze). At a table of 3, we ordered the hangover helper, shepherds pie and the tofu scramble- 3 very unique menu breakfast/brunch menu items that I was excited to try.The tofu scramble (pictured) comes in a burrito but to be honest, the best way to eat it is sans tortilla bread and topped with 2 sunny-side up eggs. The mixture of grilled firm tofu, sun-dried tomatoes, chilies and assorted veggies is surprisingly spicy and full of flavor. However, since it doesn't come with any cheese or sauce, the yolk from the eggs on top boost up the dish by a factor of 10 and make it an amazing hearty (yet healthy) meal. Too bad the eggs don't come with the dish (gotta ask for it extra). If the whole veggie/vegan/hippie roll ain't your thing, then the shepherds pie is probably the manliest breakfast you can get there. Giant piece of juicy steak and eggs sitting on a giant bed of potatoes, cheese, beans, corns and pretty much every ingredient in the kitchen. Its served on a giant skillet and will truly make you feel like a caveman eating for the next year. Props if you can finish eat, its a LOT of food. If that STILL seems too healthy for you, the hangover helper is another skillet drowning in baked tortilla, sauce and about 20lbs of melted cheese into one gooey dish. It tastes exactly like what you crave at 4am after doing too many jager-bombs in Old town. It comes with eggs, but instead it should comes with an additional 20lbs of hot sauce to accompany the cheese.Everything else really doesn't matter-  I mean, the service is decent, the crowd is good and the atmosphere is nice. I'd come back for the food in a heartbeat, maybe next time i'll snuggle up with the cat."

I have gone to the Hash House in San Diego many times, mostly for breakfast and once for lunch, but I gotta say although this one is so distant, it still has the same standard of quality.  It may SEEM pricy, but for the portions you get (enough for maybe 1-2 other meals), it's worth it.For Dinner our first night on a week long road-trip, we stopped by Vegas to try this place out.  I had the Boston Hash- the crab cakes were pretty tasty- the only other kind I have to compare it to is the one from Rainforest Cafe (EWWWW!!) and Fisherman's wharf in San Francisco (specifically Sabella and Torre- deLish!)  But the breakfast that takes the cake here is the Crispy Hand hammered pork tenderloin benedict.  The pork is just bursting with flavor and the creamy benedict sauce really complements it really well :)  I requested Jam for the huge biscuits that usually come with the entrees, and although they don't have any in the evening, the server was able to find some that was saved from the morning (Thank you!!).  It was strawberry preserves, and although it was really good, the BEST is the fresh fruit one made with blueberry/strawberry/peaches.  I commend them for their excellent service, and hope they perhaps open one in Nor Cal ;)"

We ordered the Fried Mozzarella and Stuffed Mushrooms to start. For entrees we ordered a Lobster Carbonara, Chicken Parmesan, Beef Medallions and a Bow Tie Pasta. We thought we would get one plate of each, but they brought 2 of each, one for each end of the table.  We where well fed. Dessert was my favorite. House made terramissu and Apple Cobbler. Wonderful!

For mains my dinner partner had the veal and I had the sea bass which was done perfectly.

Michael, the PA, was awesome. Very personable, knowledgeable, helpful, and empathetic.Best of all, he knew what was going on and we got everything taken care of.

After the marvellous meal I had at Kai, it was hard to imagine anywhere else in Phoenix being as good but thanks to Phoenix Yelpers, I was pointed in the direction of this little gemBinkley's is definitely a destination restaurant as it's located in the little town of Cave Creek 40 minutes drive north of Phoenix. However, it is aiming at the high end of the market and culinary experience. It reminds me of The Fat Duck in England, which is a 3 Michelin star restaurant located in a sleepy rural villageI think the phrase to sum up the dining experience at Binkley's is joie de cuire. You can sense the pure joy & excitement of discovering new tastes, textures, temperatures & combinations of food in the dishes that come out of the kitchen & as other diners have noted, these little explosions of flavour are most prominent in the numerous amuse bouches that arrive regularly through the meal. It's as if they're using the regular courses you order to draw you into the restaurant so they can share these little culinary discoveries. This molecular gastronomy style of playing & experimenting with food is also very reminiscent of The Fat Duck - if you enjoy the food at either place, you should try to eat at the other restaurant. If you prefer meat & 2 veg (British phrase!), this may not be the place for youI love the great flexibility in customising your choice of menu with the different combinations of tasting menu available. 5/6 dishes on the menu change daily depending on the ingredients availableOn arrival, I was offered a seat at the counter or table & I chose a table to better view the drama of the restaurant. It wasn't til later that I noticed a large hatch through which chef Kevin Binkley was able to keep an eye on the dining room & it was good to be able to have a chat to him at the end of my meal. Service was efficient & I was impressed that the chief server took over service at my table when I showed a geeky interest in the food & culinary techniques used in its preparationHere was my culinary extravanganza. The flavour & presentation of the food was top notch & there was a hint of drama and a few surprises with most of the dishes. I hope my descriptions can convey the playful inventiveness of the kitchen1. Arugula vichycoisse with white truffle oil. Mmm... everyone should try white truffle oil, which is a real concentration of earthy umami flavour2. Serrano ham cream with breadstick. Great ham flavour & I wanted more!3. Frozen melon dots - watermelon, canteloupe & honeydew with prosciutto powder. You could clearly taste the different flavour of each melon4. Sweet potato, ginger & prosciutto, all served on a steel skewer with lovely maple froth. Unexpected combination of ingredients and it worked!5. Cucumber, salmon mousse, quail egg a& cornichon with crisps on the side. Another lovely unusual combinatio6. 3 types of potato fried at 3 different temperatures, served with salsa verde, bean dip & aoili. Lovely and light7. Pina colada shot, served on a flashing lamplight. Lovely combination of flavours8. Duelling foie gras. The first was 'dipping dots' where torchon like foie gras was dropped into liquid nitrogen & served with passionfruit. The second was a foie gras milkshake. I have never eaten foie gras like this before!9. Pork belly with 3 preparations of watermelon - gelee, fresh & puree, with watercress sauce. I love pork belly and I love watermelon but would never have believed that they could be served together so successfully10. Pork rillette served with pickled vegetable for sweet and sour contrast to cut though the wonderfully rich pork. Accompanied by carrot foam & powder11. Mozarella cream poured over bacon & garlic confit. I had to check my terrible doctor's handwriting in my notebook twice to be sure of this combination but it's accurate! And I've written yum next to it!12. Glazed sweetbreads with macadamia & bok choy. I found the glaze a little too sweet for me & detracted from the creamy sweetbread13. Bacon & egg vol au vent with the most beautifully cooked duck egg (sous vide, I later discovered)14. Hamachi with deep fried skin (becomes like pork crackling, which I love). Accompanied by a delicate saffron cream & cippolini onions, fried grits, fava bean and lobster mushrooms15. Guava sobet palate cleanser16. Roasted tenderloin of veal & divine unctuous braised cheek done in molasses and chilli oil, eggplant puree and zuchinni. The meltingly tender cheek just fell off the fork17. Essence of lemon in 2 preparations (sorry - couldn't read notes!)18. Meringue with root beer centre & popping powder19. Choc milkshake with balsamic & a choc ball with liquid orange centre20. Huckleberry - foam in liquid nitrogen, peanut butter sandwich & fresh with vanilla creamThis is an amazing culinary extravaganza"

I had read up on the Top of the World restaurant and thought between the time of year (winter), food and views, that this place would be ideal and romantic. I had booked my reservation very easily through a website called Open Table via the Top of the World website link. However, I found a place in Vegas that sold discounted tickets and was so excited to take advantage of that. I was able to get 25% off of my entree's for the cost of only $3 per person. Basically I saved $34 for a $6 investment. Keep in mind that this offer is good but it's M-Th only and I did happen to go to the restaurant on a Monday night. The ticket place not only saved me money but also was abe to re-book my reservation for a more convenient time. So the hotel itself is what I call...ghetto-fab, and it is not located in the best part of Vegas since it is in the Stratosphere. I would only take this experience down a notch because of the location. We came dressed to impress (they do have a dress code), and we took a private elevator to the top of the Stratosphere to the restaurant entrance. We got there a little earlier than our reservation time and took advantage of their lounge area. The lounge had very ambient lighting and was surrounded by amazing night views of the city. The staff were friendly, and the drinks were well made. When it came time for dinner, we decided on an appetizer and the Surf & Turf. Everything was amazing. We received an assortment of breads and 3 different types of butter as our pre-appetizer. The butter didn't even taste like butter, it was very delicious!!! The steak cut like butter, the lobster was perfecty cooked, and our appetizer (thinly cut steak, capers, sauce), was so delicious. We skipped dessert because I was very full from dinner and I hope to try some the next time we go. We also had our pictures professionaly taken by a photographer who walks around. Prices were somewhat typical but she did a good job and I actually purchased some of the pictures. The view was amazing and we found ourselves just staring at the city for periods of time. It was very cold out (November) but we walked around on the inside and watched the crazy people do the Sky Jump off of that floor. Which is, by the way, something you get to see in the restaurant. People dropping off the top ads a different element to your dinner experience. Overall, it was well worth it (especially after getting the discount coupon), and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice place to wine and dine."

He scrimps big-time on the chicken, but the sauce of tomatoes, artichoke and so forth was plentiful and just dee-licious.  If it hadn't been too crude, I would have licked the plate!My friend ordered the lamb shank which she also liked.The thing I look for most in places like this is the Quality of the Meat!  This is the restaurant's most expensive item and if it's a low grade then you can question all the rest of the food.  Mike's isn't.  Will be back with my feed bag on here!  Mike's = damned good!

I seen it for a few years but never tried. Finally I decided to give it a shot. Being in a strip mall makes anyone have doubts. Went in and asked the most important question. Do you use trans fat free oil?? Yes!! Perfect, I'm in. The cool part is the inside. Modern look and cozy atmosphere. They have one side restaurant and the other side is bar, some bar machines and tables. The menu is straight up COMFORT food. They specialize in American Fusion. From their Famous Mac n Cheese, Pot Roast Sandwich with Buttery Mash Potatoes and bourbon glazed carrots, Citrus Marinated Chicken Fingers from Scratch with up to 12 sauces to try. Incredible selection of hand made burgers and fresh made pizza. Interesting to say the least. They have a Cheeseburger Pizza with mustard, ketchup, onions, pickles, burger, lettuce and tomato. Im sure thats whats in it, can't remember since I don't have the menu in front of me lol. Someone had ordered it across from us and it looked freaking good. The Nacho Burger was amazing. Big hand made beef patty, grilled to perfection, topped with black olives, jalapeÌ±os, tortilla chips, nacho cheese sauce on a toasted bun with Freedom Fries. Gooey goodness on a perfectly cooked beef patty. The Blackened Chicken Sandwich was spectacular. Marinated and blackened seasoned Chicken breast on a toasted wheat bun, topped with pineapple salsa, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onions and served with Freedom Fries. The Fries are so crispy and perfectly seasoned with their own special seasoning salt. They definitely make you addicted. I felt like a pig after devouring everything and wanting more fries. But I resisted lol. The chicken fingers were AMAZING!!! Fresh chicken fillets that are marinated in Citrus. Then freshly hand battered and fried perfectly crisp. The sauces to choose from range from mild to Nuclear hot. They even have a caption no refunds if its to hot lol. I prefer Buffalo Hot cuz I iove the flavor or an authentic buffalo wing. I can go on and on. The menu is definitely something try and enjoy. Can't wait to try some of their pastas and comfort food selections. Until next time, LET'S EAT!!!!"

Unlike other Vegas buffets where you stand and wait in line, you first walk up to one of the kiosk machines and input your name, phone number, and party size. Once Bacchanal has an available spot for your party, you will receive a text and ask you to check-in and pay at the cashier within 15 minutes. The estimated waiting was supposedly 70 minutes, but we only waited for 30 minutes. Honestly, this whole place did feel like a mini food heaven. You can find dim sum in the Chinese section, prime rib in the meat section, pre-cut crab legs in seafood section, a juice bar with freshly made fruit / vegetable juices, and many more. Plate 1: BBQ pork, roasted duck, sushi, sashimi, dim sum (har gow, shumai), beef chow fun: For a buffet, all Chinese and Japanese food tasted pretty much hit the spot. Just don't expect these food to be five-star quality.Plate 2: Fried chicken, smoked brisket, bone-in prime rib, sweet potato tots, Wagyu beef sliders: I thought sweet potato tots was pretty unique and Wagyu beef sliders was definitely a highlight. Unfortunately, prime rib and fried chicken were average at best. The prime rib at Wynn Buffet tasted so much better. Plate 3: mussels, oysters, crab legs, chef special (mushroom polenta), sauteed mushrooms: Pre-sliced FRESH crab legs? Fresh mussels and oysters? This must be a seafood heaven! Plate 4: creme brulee, egg tart, almond cookie, green tea cookie with azuki beans, pecan sticky buns: Other than pecan sticky buns, everything else tasted amazing. That creme brulee ... I can eat that thing 3 times a day. Gelato (Thai tea + red bean flavors) and horchata: One of the best gelato I've had, but it melt so quickly =(. Oh and horchata is a must try - sooooo good. Main takeaway: Wynn Buffet has better prime ribs and Bacchanal Buffet has better desserts (and horchata). Not a perfect buffet, but you definitely get what you pay for."

It's beautiful inside -- shiny and clean, and the staff seem friendly. There's even a full wall window where you can watch the food being made.The croissants seem roughly on par with those from French bakeries in town, and the macaroon I had was delicious albeit a little strange since it was basil and white chocolate flavored.Their almond croissant is tougher and less sweet than the like from, La Gourmandine, but still good.Overall, I'm not sure it's quite as good as La Gourmandine or Jean-Marc Chatellier's, but it's definitely in a more convenient location for me, and to be fair, it's trying to fill a slightly different niche than the other ones.

There's a small buffet with some hot dishes, sandwiches, and a salad bar along with free drinks at the bar, as well as some nice iced teas. Bowls of fresh fruit are placed around on tables as well. Seating is plentiful, with an array of comfortable couches, armchairs, lounge cubicles/pods, tables for working, and a business centre. Outlets are plentiful as well and are scattered around the lounge in strategic locations. Sadly, no showers are available, unlike DFW. All of the staff are super friendly, and there are employees walking around to clear dishes periodically and check up on patrons. The only drawback is that there aren't any airline staff to help with flight issues; for that, you'll have to go to an actual airline lounge or see the gate agent. Entrance is complimentary for Centurion and Platinum cardholders and is definitely a perk I appreciate. Otherwise, a day pass runs at $50, which is well worth it if you have a long layover or delay - the lounge is a welcome respite from the general hubbub of LAS and an excellent way to pass the time before your flight."

Ok, so for the past two days (June 7th & 8th), the hubs and I have been celebrating and partying like we were back in College. It was our 3rd Anniversay and my 27th birthday so we hit up a few places in Charlotte and we were not disappointed. After we checked out of the Sierra Hotel (which I will be reviewing in a lil' bit) the hubs took me to New Zealand Cafe for lunch. It's off North Sardis road in a strip mall type setting.I was really excited to be having lunch here b/c all the sushi buffs I know have been saying this is the best sushi in Charlotte. AND THEY WEREN'T LIEING! At first glance I didn't know what to make of the decor, it's a hodge-podge of japanese design/nautical elements/viking-esque wall art. But I wasn't here for the decor, I wanted to inhale some SUSHI! We were greeted instantly and told to grab a seat, so we sat near the door as everywhere else was taken. I can't remember the name of our server, but she was very petite and wore a big smile. She took our drink order and handed us three different menus. The hubs told her it was my birthday and with that she smiled and said, ""Oooh you get a free meal today!"" I was estatic, I showed her my DL and she pointed out what I could order for free. I chose the Hibachi Chicken and Shrimp platter, I also ordered a Sweet Dragon Roll and the hubs ordered a Rainbow Roll.It took about 10 minutes and I was in Sushi heaven...the sweet dragon roll was perfect dipped in my concoction of soy sauce, wasabi and mayo dipping sauce. Now on to the Hibachi Chicken and Shrimp platter that came out in a cute little tray. It was an assortment of crab-n-creme cheese wontons, chicken on a stick, broccoli, onions. zuchini and of course shrimp and chicken. It was sooo good! The sushi was so fresh, you could tell they use the best ingredients. The portion was the perfect size although I could not finish the entire roll but the hubs was on hand to polish off what I couldn't.All-in-all, New Zealand Cafe gets five stars for it's friendly servers, mom and pop feel and quality sushi! :-)"

A bit of a crust on the outside and doughy and delicious on the inside with garlic butter drizzled over top served with a delicious marinara for dunking. A must get when you come here.   The wings were fantastic! Perfect crisp outside and moist and tender inside. I loved the sweet chili hot sauce too. So far 2 for 2....now the pie. We ordered a large onion, mushroom and meatball pizza. It came out steaming hot and absolutely loaded with toppings. We loved it!!! A perfect mix of a crisp bottom crust, sauce, tons of toppings and cheese. Could only eat two pices after we demolished the knots and wings but bonus on taking leftovers home.

It's a simple yet very elegant restaurant, which seems suitable for afternoon casual lunch or fancy business meetings or dates.  The menu had a variety of options from light salads and oysters, to fancy sandwiches, to meat hefty meals.  I ordered the tomato and basil salad.  The waitress said it was a pretty decent size and tasty.  It was indeed tasty, but not substantial in size.  I was thankful I ordered chicken with it because it is not enough on it's own (for most people).  It was very fresh and lightly seasoned with oil.  I sneaked bites from the plates of those around me....the yellowfin was delish and the goat cheese and smoked salmon sandwich is probably the best thing one could order from the lunch menu!  The combined flavor of the bread, cheese, salmon and toppings was one of the most decadent things I've eaten in awhile!  So why 4 stars and not 5?  The service was lacking.

Since I haven't put in my two cents about one of the most awesome things about Madison summer and fall, I decided its time to review the farmers market.Very near and dear to my heart, the farmers market (specifically on Saturdays) is not only a place to see and be seen by friends and the entire community, it is also the perfect way to start out your day. Yes local farmers sell fruits and vegetables, but you can get so much more beyond that:CHEESE, cheese spreads, cheese curds, local honey, maple syrup, pastries, bread, coffee, plants, cut flowers, popcorn, fish, game, sausage, eggs, beeswax candles, specialty garlic, goat cheese and ice cream, jam, springtime flower bulbs, pumpkins and gourds, hot peppers, homespun yarn, Amish-made fruit pies, and the list continues...Set surrounding the state capitol building with street musicians performing, and local kids groups doing random shows, and political booths at every corner, so much happens in the community during this weekly gathering.

Add to this the enormous menu of bottled beer and all other things malted and you have one amazing place. This is a nice casual place to indulge in that beverage you've been wanting to try. There are no games, no televisions, only music played at non-deafening levels. They don't serve food but they keep a stack of menus of places that do deliver. The outside seating is very urban, as it is on a the corner of a busy intersection. If you've never been, visit during happy hour for discounts on tap beers. If you love craft beer or single malt, you owe it to yourself to visit the Malt House."

I have been wanting to try the thin man sandwich shop ever since I started reading the reviews on Yelp.  Whenever we walked in the first thing that I noticed was the chalkboard menu.  There was also the area behind the counter where they were making the sandwiches and a few seats downstairs at counters looking out the windows.  I also noticed that they had some additional seating upstairs but did not make it up there.  After looking over the menu I asked the girl taking my order if they could substitute some of the bread types with a flatbread or a wrap since my fiance does not eat bread but they could not.  I ended up ordering The Braised Duck Leg.  It consisted of some shredded duck leg, black garlic, a scallion pancake, ginger braised celery on a sesame kaiser while my fiancÌ© had the everything hummus and split the Mac and cheese with me.  After about a ten minute wait at one of the windows looking out over Smallman Street, our number was called and we received our food.  My sandwich came in what looked like butchers paper and whenever I opened it up I was disappointed in the size of it.  Basically it was the same size sesame kaiser that you would get from McDonalds or Burger King with one of their bigger sandwiches only of better quality.  I will admit that the duck inside of it was delicious as it was juicy and cooked perfectly.  The ginger braised celery was also nice and gave it a little bit of a crunch.   Finally the scallion pancake I could see on the sandwich but I did not think that it added very much.  Overall though I was pleased with the great flavoring and amount of duck for the sandwich size.  After finishing my sandwich I decided to try the hummus which my fiance said she loved.  It was interesting in that along with the chickpea flavor, it really did taste like an everything bagel with the poppy and sesame seeds coming through the most.  Finally the mac and cheese was also pretty good.  It was baked together in the oven and came to us in two little triangles covered with a crispy topping.  The flavoring of it was good and I enjoyed the presentation as well as the topping which I suspect may have been Shake and Bake? The bottom line for me is that I may come back here in the future.  The food that I ate itself deserves a five star review as it was good but the $9.50 I paid for my sandwich certainly did not fill me up, not even with some mac and cheese and hummus.  So while the food itself is good I would be prepared to either spend a lot of money or plan to eat a snack elsewhere afterwards which is what I ended up doing."

It was noon and the line was a bit long, however the wait was only 20 minutes. This might indicate that they were churning out customers, however that was not the case at all. We spent time talking to the hostess, waiter and manager, however Gordon wasn't there. We missed him by 2 days.  I was hung over so I opted for the Farm Burger which included an egg and duck breast bacon.  Perfect.   We also enjoyed onion rings which were the best I have ever eaten.  My only regret was that I was only able to finish 1/2 of my beer.  30 on tap.  The service, food, prices and atmosphere are excellent for a casual meal.  With so many choices in Vegas to eat its hard to go wrong, however I do not give out 5 stars often and BurGR well deserves all 5."

This place is legit, I actually ended up ordering the Ronin burger and truffle Parmesan fries and a 1/4 of my wife's Kiki burger, also so good! Lastly, we ordered the soufflÌ© which was more like a lava cake with vanilla ice cream but so damn good too.

On my recent trip to Las Vegas I made forever into now. It was everything I had ever dreamed of since I heard 2Pac rap about it back in the '90s, not to mention my partner in crime has gone on and on about them too. This finally came to fruition after walking about two miles and then also almost getting hit by a car (apparently crosswalks mean nothing in Vegas).I had the double double, animal style, with fries, animal style and a lemonade. Absolutely amazing. The burgers were so much better than anticipated. I was so glad I finally got to try it. It sucks so hard there are none back here in Chicago. The animal style really adds a lot of flavor to an already very tasty burger. The wait was a bit long, though there were a ton of people in there. It has a very '50s atmosphere that brings a little bit extra awesome to eating at boring old fast food places. The fries were really good too. This was confirmed by my vegetarian that accompanied us. He also had the naked burger which is just like a grilled cheese with all the toppings on it. He said that was alright, but really enjoyed the fries. Nice and crispy, and hot too.All in all this was everything I wanted. And it really makes me regret not living out west as we could have it all the time. Ugh, I want some nowwwww."

We were immediately seated at a table, I asked our server if we could move to a booth as a family just left and the live music was a tad bit too loud. She quickly cleaned up the booth and let us move! The music was still a bit loud, but it was much more cozier in the corner booth. We ordered a pepperoni pizza, mozzarella sticks and baked medium chicken wings. A-H-MAZING. Their marinara is homemade and delicious. Their wing sauce had just the perfect kick and the pizza was absolutely delicious, so ooey and gooey!Our server was awesome. Sadly I do not remember her name. But she was on top of her game. Very welcoming and personable. She checked in on us a lot but not too much. And she didn't ask how the food was as we took a bite ;) By far the best part about this experience was finding out it is family owned and operated. The owner actually checked in on us as well.

I also highly appreciate the fact that they use separate cookware and plates for their vegan dishes.My biggest problem with Scramble is their consistency. The food just doesn't come out the same way every time.My first visit to try the tofu/soyrizo burrito resulted in a burrito that was extra oily and sweet potato hash that was blackened (burnt) and extra oily.My next visit (today) resulted in a burrito with tofu that wasn't cooked/seasoned as well as the last time (big chunks of white tofu). The sweet potato hash was good this time.I'd also like to see a bit more soyrizo added to the burritos.The miniature cup of salsa provided with these dishes should also be increased in size, as it's easy to run through in a few bites.I still really dig the place, I just hope that they get their cooking/prep down so that the dishes turn out more consistent and better.I'd also like to see a vegan Brizza (breakfast pizza) added to the menu (with tofu instead of egg)."

My last visit, I shared an amazing slice of chocolate cake (very rich and surprisingly like the non-vegan variety), two delicious juices, the raw tacos, and a loaded baked potato quesadilla.

We scored there,  basically it was buy one get one free.~ Guess knowing what I know now, I'd would've paid full price.Our host was Jody...  So funny they have 2 women who work there with similar names.  Anyway she was helpful, informative and just really nice.We had a small tour bus which I like, you get to know all the people in your group and recognize them going about your day.It went faster then I expected.  We had 2 stops along the way.  Since we took the express no lunch was included.  For breakfast they gave us pastry & juice.  So we stopped about 20 minutes from strip in Boulder City.There a few of us picked up lunch items to eat on the bus.  *Food & drinks at Canyon are pricy.  So if you don't want to pay for over priced food, take her up on the stop and get something at the store.We had 3 hours at the Canyon.  Was just about right amount of time I thought.  We got to see everything and didn't feel rushed.  Although we didn't do the Skywalk experience (was $32 and not worth it to me)We got fantastic pictures and although it was chilly with wind and temp it was so worth seeing one of America's best/biggest natural destinations.  Had 1 stop half way through on way back.  Very interesting/colorful stop.  I'll have to post my pics of the Last Stop Saloon!Jody played us a movie which was fun and passed the time.  Although I didn't watch most of it because I took a nice little nap, being up so early in the morning while in Vegas leads to sleeping if you don't have to drive... or at least thats what I think."

Judging from a man who has carried a camera since he was 8, I think most of his exposures and shots were all mastered by technique. Tranquility was used with a very slow shutter, overcasted weather, and proper natural lighting. I believe a couple of his canyon pieces he worked on took a few days because he had to keep coming back and sitting around for hours to capture the proper lighting for it.  Any photographer knows the cost and expenses for exposing their own work on paper and in a dark room, so you can only imagine why his work is marked at high prices. He just doesn't print these pictures out from a printer. The galleries are remarkable. The staff is usually very passionate about their work, and regardless if you are looking to buy or not, they are always willing to show you their light demonstration. Definitely stop by to see their light demonstration even if you have nothign to do or want to do something, or even impress a date! They take you to a dark room which displays one of his work and they put it under studio lights. They then change the lighting from dim to bright and you see the difference of the lighting affect the photo by the skies adjusting from afternoon bright sky to sunset. It'as pretty fascinating and different. I think it's an experience and a must see. Rest assure that you can leave the gallery without a judging eye lurking at you for not buying."

So when my girlfriend gave us free passes to go to the top of the Eiffel Tower at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas, I shrugged and said ""Better late than never I guess!"" The entrance to the Eiffel Tower is located in the center of the casino right next to the gift shop. My girlfriend had gotten VIP tickets which normally cost a little more but are totally worth the price because you get to jump the ridiculously long lines. We were escorted to the elevator and up we went to the top of the Eiffel Tower. The balcony area was packed with people and we edged our way towards an unobstructed view of the city. It was about 7 pm and the landscape of Sin City was lit up like Christmas! Standing at the top of the steel replica was a wonderful way to see the lights of the Las Vegas strip and the Bellagio fountains.

Since we're at a timeshare I'm enjoying making breakfast most of the week.  On a lark I decide we're going out, and I google ""best las vegas breakfast"".  #1 on the list is ""The Egg and I"".  So we map it and off we go, without a lot of expectations or knowing what's on the menu.  So first of all there's a bit of a wait - 15-20 minutes for a table.  Staff is friendly, place is clean, and every table is filled.  We are seated outdoors on the patio and there are heaters set up (the stand-up propane ones) every couple of tables so we're nice and cozy.Coffee comes and guess what - it's really good.  I'm a bit of a coffee fanatic - I roast my own beans at home and can distinguish varietals between African and South American by taste - and it's surprisingly lively on the palette for a breakfast joint.Between the four of us, we order a vegan breakfast, two different omelets and biscuits and gravy.  Each entry is under $10, and the portions are absolutely ginormous.  It's a quarter to midnight and I'm still stuffed.  But most importantly, every thing on the plate is absolutely delicious.  From the specialty omelets to the potatoes to the gravy, everything is simply first rate.  Apparently the place has won several awards and is Zagat rated.  I have no reason to doubt any of this - if you're in Las Vegas for breakfast, you absolutely MUST search out and try The Egg and I."

A tasty breakfast at the famed Bouchon.We only had 40 minutes and the staff was super accommodating with our schedule, taking orders from 1/2 of us who had to leave and bringing out the food quite quickly. My coffee took a big longer to arrive but they were hustling for the most part.The place is just beautiful, bright and open with tall ceilings, and leading to the outdoor area of the Venetzia tower patio, it takes a trek to get there from any of the other Venetian towers, but after your first bite, the 15 minute maze-like walk through suites and visits to multiple elevators easily becomes worth it.Strawberry croissant was THE pastry of the day and it lived up to the hype. i I figured...come on...a croissant is a croissant right ? Some butter and strawberries in a flakey crust. been there done that, many times over. Heck No. When this thing arrived, split in half lengthwise, topped with strawberries and jam and then some sort of crumbly top crust which had then been baked, it was an ooey gooey yummy mess of strawberries and flakiness with a sweet crumbly topping--reminded me a bit of strudel topping. Sweet cinnamony goodness. And that was just the pastry that came with my 'breakfast americaine'. It also came with eggs (whites for me), a huge container of pomme frites, brioche toast, sausage AND bacon, orange juice AND coffee. It was more food than even *I* could put away in one sitting.We manhandled our swollen bellies back over to the palazzo, got our stuff and checked out....powered for hours on end through the airport visit and even after getting home on the amazing 'farewell to Vegas' breakkie we had at Bouchon."

Here are my two cents on the more classic and unconventional items on the menu:Jellyfish appetizer - My husband loves this.  Fresh and crisp with the right combination of sweetness and tart. although I still dont know if this is really jellyfish or some type of seaweed??Steamed minced pork with salted egg - steamed pork does not sound very appetizing but this dish is full of flavor.  The salted egg on top gives it a nice kick in the mouth with a grainy texture.Salt n Pepper Sea Bass - everyone knows you can put salt n pepper to pretty much everything.  You could never go wrong with the classic pork chops, calamari n shrimp but I must tell you that the Sea Bass has the perfect crunchiness on the outside and buttery inside.Pan Fried Noodles HK style - I prefer this just with the noodles and chinese brocolli.  The gravy-type sauce is subtle with al dente noodles.  A great substitute for rice!  It is the HK version of garlic noodles :)XO String Beans - the perfect veggie match for deep fried protein.   Salty and a little spicy (Correct me if Im wrong but I actually think this has bits of pork or shrimp in it)Deep Fried Flounder - A whole fish for just $5 on their lunch special! Can't get any better than that!So if you are craving for REAL Chinese cuisine, you've come to the right place.  If you are less adventurous, you can stick with PF Chang's ;)"

I can't argue with that. They taste like birthday cake, minus the icing. Fluffy, moist, and the right amount of sweet. The country fried steak is a must try! Hailing from the mid-west, a good fried steak is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. They DO that here. They use the same technique with their hash browns. Add some Heinz 57 to them, you're in for treat.  Although located in a busy area and at times can be packed full of people, it's worth making the stop.

It is actually inside the casino and up an escalator so don't bother looking for it from the strip. You'll just get lost. I came here with about 20 people (yea. 20.) and knew about the long waits but we were all willing to eat here. The hostess quoted us a 45 minute wait but surprisingly we were seated in ~25 mins despite the large amount of people in the lobby. I felt bad for the waitress though as she had to yell across the three connected tables to all twenty of us to explain the menu. She sounded like she was losing her voice but she had a very cheerful attitude nonetheless. Portions are ginormous so just share; I recommend it. I split the sage fried chicken Benedict with my gf and it was way more than enough. We also split the snickers pancake with another couple with us. The Benedict was very tasty and stacked high, about 7 inches in height, 12 inches if you include the rosemary sprigs sticking out of it. It could've been that we were starving and getting over our hangovers but it was an amazing combination eggs potatoes fried chicken gravy spinach and bacon. I'm glad we shared the pancake because it was huge as well, probably at 12-13 inches in diameter with chunks of snickers everywhere. Also very sweet so I only ate about 3-4 bites of it and had to stop.Very affordable assuming you split the dish with another person. Fyi the bathroom is downstairs in the casino area.

One order is two pieces of sushi. That's the short version. Here's the longer version:My sisters, fiancÌ© and I went to try Goyemon. My fiancÌ© and I had been there previously. We have noticed that they really get packed every time and there is a momentary wait for a table. We really enjoyed our two experiences there. I took a star off specifically for their service. It is hit or miss with their service. They either accidentally overservice you or underservice you or some times bring food to the wrong table or bring you the wrong item. I'm sure in the future they will have a better protocol and perhaps create SECTIONS!However, their fish is extremely fresh, their waiters are truly friendly and the vibe matches its hype. They do not pack on tons of rice to their sushi to try and fill you up. They really seem to want you to try everything.Their desserts, such as the green tea creme brulÌ©e, are of utmost divinity. They also have cooked foods such as ramen and yellowtail collar (which they run out of very fast).There is one thing that I did not enjoy there. It's called the Screaming Orgasm. The tuna meat used in the tuna poke dish was fit for tar tar. It was a nice try to disguise leftover pieces of fish with the screaming orgasm sauce, but it was subpar for my taste.I would say for everything they have on the menu and to only have one small complaint is a huge feat.

As we drove through the parking lot, we were stunned to see how busy it was.  The private lot was packed and we took the last parking space.  (There were still cars coming in as we walked into the restaurant.)  Could there be private event?As I took a quick peek in, it didn't seem like it was closed for a party.  We took the last of the two tables available, which was our luck since the rest of our dinner there was a large group of people waiting.  Checking out our fellow diners, and we were surrounded by Indians and non-Indians.  This place was was ridiculously busy!  As a result, it took awhile to get our orders in and for our food to come.  It looked like a new restaurant inside with the simple decorations and complementing paint choices.  (As other yelper mentioned, they just renovated.)  A lone TV behind the bar showed Bollywood videos throughout the meal.  They also have two smaller rooms off to the sides.The Husband and I both ordered a Mango Lassi ""Sweet yogurt based shake made with mango pulp."" ($3.95) to start and it was probably one of the best I've had.  Presented in a copper cup, I would say they give you more than other places do.We both chose a dinner special, which comes with chicken or dal soup; choice of bread - plain naan, garlic naan, or roti; basmatic rice and mango custard.The Dal Soup ""A traditional veggie soup with delicately spiced lentils."" was simple, but tasty.  A nice start to our meal.The Garlic Naan was a generous amount, and we actually had leftovers.  It was tasty with lots of garlic.My Vegetable Dinner Special included ""Saag Paneer, Navratan Korma, Dal Makhani, Raita"" ($19.95).  The Saag Paneer ""Creamy spicy spinach with chunks of homemade cheese."" is usually a favorite of The Husband's, so I let him have most of it.  It was good, but not my favorite. The Navratan Korma ""Mixed veggies with cheese in a creamy sauce with cashews, almonds & raisins."" was a favorite though, probably because I love creamy sauces in Indian cooking. The Dal Makhani ""Lentil delicacy flavored with onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic & cream."" was also very good as well, because I love lentils and cream!  The Raita ""Yogurt seasoned with cumin, cucumber, tomatoes & mint."" has never been something I could enjoy, so The Husband enjoyed most of it.The Husband went for the Rack of Lamb Dinner Special ""Rack of Lamb, Malai Kofta, Aloo Matar"" ($25.95).  The Malai Kofta ""Cheese & vegetable balls in an aromatic gravy."" was a bit interesting, as we would say.  It's considered a ""House Favorite"" but it was just a bit weird for us.  The Aloo Matar ""Green peas cooked with diced potatoes and aromatic spices in a curry sauce."" was yummy, as most Indian curry dishes are.  The rack of lamb was also good, and loaded with tons of onions and bell peppers, which The Husband ate up.The Mango Custard was a light simple liquid custard drink with chunks of fruit in it.  Not exactly what I call a custard, but more like a thicker lassi.Service was okay - when our waiter finally took our order, the food took awhile and our bill took awhile too.  The women serving the food could use a little brush up on how to clear a table.  Simple things like clearing the soup bowls before bringing out the other food might help a bit.  We were seated at a small table, so it was crowded with all our mini dishes.Overall, India Palace served up some good Indian food.  In general, I love the intense spices used in Indian cooking, and you definitely get it here.  I can't say how authentic it is, but from the many Indians eating there, I take that as a good sign.  It is a bit pricey though compared to other Indian restaurants."

Although I still believe that to be true, I have to admit that Alex was the best meal I ever had from ""soup to nuts"" or in this case ""amuse bouche to cheese course"". The food was spectacular. The service was impeccable. The room is sleek, sophisticated and yet comfortable and unintimidating. The sommelier was enormously helpful picking out a wonderful Burgundy and then helping us pair our wine with the cheese course. Even though the expense is great, there's one thing that differs from dining in NYC. You can try to win your meal money back right outside the restaurant door at the black jack tables."

I've yet to really find a place that really amazed me enough to write a review until I came here. Talk about your hole in the wall establishment, this place is in some random corner that you'd never pay attention to. It's really small, but the setting is really nice. I liked the small setting, it made the meal much more intimate. The server was really informative. First thing he did was show us pictures on a tablet. He explained how the broth was made and made it a point to say there was no MSG at all. Once we were finished ordering, he showed us how to make our own sauces to dip our food in. I've had plenty of hot pots, but this hot pot here has the BEST broth I have ever tasted. I ordered the lamb pot and the broth was so flavorful and fresh. You can order plenty of sides so you can add additional things to your pot. I ordered a side of noodles and it was perfect. The broth made the noodles taste perfect. The only small complaint I would have is that my pot didn't have so much meat, but the broth was so amazing, that I really only focused on the soup anyways. You could order a side of additional meat as well so my tiny complaint can be solved. If you ever want to have the best broth of your life, come here, trust me. It ended my yelp review virginity.

Amidst the clanging machines and the NASCAR fans late night whoop whoops in the casino, the bang-bang of the machine guns was a welcome respite! Seriously, the Mob Museum has so much to offer to the most enamored and infatuated mafia wanna-bes (it's romantic) and to those who have a genuine thirst for knowledge and history.There are so many different types of media to view, old newspaper clippings, mob memorabilia, FBI files, films on ""hits"", ""Hollywood"", old Vegas, senate hearings, and interactive exhibits. You start on the top floor in a ""line up"" where the museum page will take a picture of you along side four others. As you wind through the top floor maze, there is so much to read about the history of the mob (throughout the world and Vegas). It gets a little dizzying and the information is overwhelming. I just started scanning everything, then went to picking and choosing the parts that interested me the most. Had I stayed and read each little piece (and I am a fast reader), I doubt we would have left before the building closed for the evening (and we arrived at 10:30 am).  The second floor houses a courtroom that presented Senate hearings. Not only interesting, but it provided the ability to sit a spell after standing throughout most of the top floor. The second floor continues the story of the mob ""connections"" and the individual infamous mobsters. By the time you get to the first and last floor, you pretty much know what happened to all of them, and the status of the ""mob"" in today's world.  We took about three hours to see everything, which included watching all the films and listening to most of the information displays, playing with the machine gun, the interactive ""shooting the bad guy"" exhibit, and a quick tour through the gift shop.Definitely worth the price of admission and then some!"

I have come to believe that most of us generally desire that unique union of a robust menu composed of carefully planned and executed dishes with a splash of unique drinks, a dazzling wine selection, excellent service that offer suggestions to round out a dining experience, and finally an atmosphere that lets us focus on our palette not our survival instincts. If your generally in agreement with me then the Capital Grille is right up your prospective alley and will definitely set the bar higher. While the steaks are absolutely excellent, they take a great amount of pride and care in the preparation of everything. Starting with the appetizers, the oyster and shellfish platters were well done and exceptionally fresh especially when you consider we are in the middle of the desert. The Kona Sirlon was cooked to absolute perfection and the rub composed of coffee and other seasonings gave you all the more reason to linger over every bite. The dinner service was absolutely perfect, he remained observant and ensured we were taken care of without being obtrusive seemingly allowing us to dine from the horn of plenty."

In the past few months I've had Rafael over my house - once to measure and show me options for window coverings, and the second time, very last minute, to do a final measurement and place our order.   The service at Bugsy's has been outstanding. So much so that I never even bothered pricing or looking anywhere else! And that's very uncharacteristic for a Yelper! One of the best things Bugsy's offers is their ""upgrade"" option. Buy any window covering from them and the price will be applied to a future upgrade. There's no expiration on this, which is excellent if you want to upgrade or just replace your window coverings any time in the future. Rafael totally had all our best interests in mind - our needs, cost, design, etc. He showed us good options at great prices and gave excellent advice. I'm confident, with his help, that all of our window coverings are going to be high quality and look fantastic. He is courteous, professional, and very respectful of our home (always took his shoes off going upstairs on the carpet). I'm so excited for the project to be completed and I don't think we could have gotten better service anywhere! I will update this after we receive the final product and installation is complete."

That was the one drawback that I can note.  I would have loved for the show to be at least 30 minutes longer.This show has water, which makes it similar to O, but it's not a Cirque show.  I saw O several years back, and I think I liked this show better.  This theater seems better suited to the show than the O theater is.  In looking around, I don't think there was a bad seat in the house for Le Reve. I loved the high dives and the dancing on the water.

The zero cola tasted watered down, no bueno, but the orange cream soda was tasty.Will we come back...Heck yeah!  True, it's pretty pricey, but lucky for us, we don't eat pizza often.  However, when we do crave for pizza, we will definitely have Pizza Fusion on the top of our list."

Thank you Samz Market!I'd describe the food as a deli, gelato, and specialty foods store rolled into one.  Spacious clean and locally owned its the perfect place for lunch.  I had ""The Venice"", which consists of French roll, delicious soft prosciutto, amazingly flavor full mozzarella,  and crisp fresh lettuce on tomato.

It's even better when I accidentally stumble upon a coffee gold mine, like I did Dolce Espresso.I unwittingly locked myself and my dog out of my house this morning and lucky for me I had a phone and a wallet to remedy the situation.  We walked down to Camelback and headed west from 12th street and right before 10th street on our way to check out Noble Beast and wait for a friend with a key, I came across this little coffee shop tucked away between a Psychic and Anne's Flower and Gift Shop.  When I walked in, the owner, Cesar, greeted me politely and shared with me his special light, dark, and medium roast coffee blend that comes from beans all over the world.  Perfectly roasted and just-right bitterly delicious.  I ordered an egg, spinach, and provolone sandwich on a bagel which was tasty and filling.The place itself is pretty nifty and ready to cater to the urban Phoenix crowd. Plenty of tables and chairs along with a couple sofas and three plasma TV's makes this place an optimal choice for someone looking to grab a quick bite, sit down and enjoy a cup of smooth coffee, or relax and take advantage of their free WiFi.  The best part of it all?  Cesar keeps the place open til midnight during the week, and it's 24 hours all weekend.  So instead of stumbling drunk into Denny's after a dance-off with a gay cowboy at Charlie's, head to Dolce and choose from any of their delicious sandwiches (breakfast and lunch) and a beverage to sober up and shoot the shit about the night's crazy shenanigans.  This is exactly what central Phoenix needs.  Here's to great awakenings for this charming little coffee shop that's willing to do what no other business in the area wants to - stay open past 10pm.  And it's ""family"" owned to, so I'm proud to blow this place up."

We went for restaurant week, which I have learned can either be good or bad. (During one restaurant week several years ago I was served overcooked chicken on what could only have been canned peas and corn-we never went back for the regular menu) I was impressed by Lon's.Ambiance: Excellent although next time we will request a patio seat. If it isn't 100 degrees outside, I suggest you do the same. Staff was excellent. Our server was introduced to us as ""Frenchie."" We immediately found out why. She was thorough and thoughtful with her recommendations.Food: Now here is where it gets complicated. I had the chilled pea soup and I thought it was really great. Flavor was good, ingredients and style were all appropriate for the weather. The roasted chicken was my next course and  thought this was great too. Overall, excellent food until I tried the boy's calamari- not so much. I know many people appreciate large portions but the law of diminishing returns applies to one's appetite as well. The calamari was large, deep fried and piled high. Bloated and uncomfortable after consuming large quantities of fried food, he wasn't even slightly hungry after he finished the first course. Now, I know, he could have stopped eating the on his own. I agree. he made a personal choice to eat the fried but I think there has to be some portion planning on the chef's part as well or at least a warning ""Caution: you will not be interested in any other food item after consumption of the calamari"". Needless to say he was not impressed at all with his second course, the hanger steak. Wine: lots of options- very pleased."

Most so-called Mexican places in the Valley are very mediocre and over-priced for what you're getting.  A family friend (also from NM) recommended New Mexican Grill. Trusting their judgement, I had to see for myself what the fuss was about. Walking in, my first impression was that the place in very simple. A big menu greets you just as you walk in the door.  An ordering counter and kitchen to the left, simple table set-ups to the right, and a self-serve chips and salsa bar in the middle. Looked like the crew that was working on Sunday was pretty young, so you never know  how that will go. We placed our order and helped ourselves to chips and salsa. After a few bites I knew we were in for a good meal. The salsas had that distinctive fire-roasted taste that so few other places do. Big thumbs up. The service was prompt and the food arrived at our table in no time at all. Our group had a little bit of everything, with each item more delicious than the next. The ground beef enchiladas with red sauce and a fried egg were like something straight out of my grandmas kitchen. The green pork tamales were moist and full of flavor. The carne asada tacos were overflowing with tender steak nestled in warm tortillas. It seriously took some will power to NOT go back and order another dinner.If you are looking for an authentic New Mexican meal packed with mouth watering flavors at a very reasonable price, look no further than New Mexican Grill."

The portions seem small until you eat with naan and rice and then it really isn't.  Hands down the best naan I've had around here (because it's fresh and not overcooked)  The saag, CTM, Eggplant were all very good and spicy.  The owner is a cool dude who checks on you frequently and is a very nice person.  The decor is very bright.  For me could be a little cooler in the restaurant, but minor quibble.

Immediately, fresh bread was brought to our table and our drink and food orders were placed (when in France, order Kronenbourg).  Our food arrived promptly. I had the mushroom quiche which I thoroughly enjoyed an my wife had the chicken and gruyere cheese crepe, which was tasty as well.

I deserve a hand slap. But last week, I had the perfect excuse to pay a long overdue visit during Yelp Eats Week! We went on Friday night and to make a long story short, this is the perfect date spot and the perfect restaurant for delectable dining. But let me dive into details a bit more. First of all, the atmosphere here is vibrant and alive, but it lacks the ""so Scottsdale"" vibe that some similar spots may have. For this reason alone, I will become a regular at Roka Akor. There's plenty of seating inside, including seats at the bar, romantic couch seating in the lounge, front row sushi seating at the sushi bar and then plenty of normal dining all around. We sat at a normal dinner table and took in the fun environment surrounding us. The staff here is incredibly friendly and attentive. We arrived on time for our 8:30 dinner reservation and were seated promptly upon arrival. The server welcomed us immediately and gave a descriptive overview of the food and serving style they suggest for the restaurant. Since we were there for Yelp Eats, I definitely wanted to take advantage of some of the Yelp Eats musts, so we ordered the Grilled Sweet Corn (Roka Akor signature dish), the Skirt Steak and the Warm Toffee Cake for dessert. But, that just didn't seem like enough, so added on the rock shrimp tempura and Kobe beef and Kimchi Dumplings -- two more Roka Akor signature dishes. Since there is so much delicacy to discuss, I'll break it down by dish. Grilled Sweet Corn -- as sweet as it sounds. I felt like I was in a scene out of the movie Big because the corn is petite and cut into halves, so I found myself nipping away on each tiny ear. The corn was grilled perfectly and had just the right amount of zing. *** PS -- probably not the food choice for a first or second date.Rock Shrimp Tempura -- by far my favorite dish of all and the top anywhere in the Valley. It's fried, it's tangy, it's spicy, it's crunchy, it's just delicious. I could eat an entire bowl (or two) just by myself. Kobe Beef Dumplings -- they were tasty and the perfect compliment to the meal. They were filling but not overly filling and with five to a plate, it's just the right amount for two. Skirt Steak -- I don't even know where to start. They give you a good amount of steak and it's perfectly tender, moist and delicious. We let them pick how it ""should"" be prepared and that's the right move. It was medium well and the perfect amount of rare and well done at once. The marination on it provided the perfect sweetness and it was just the right amount of steak. It's a great dish to share as well. Finally, the Toffee Cake -- this is a great way to end the meal with a sweet touch. Delicate and delightful. I almost forget about the sake. The sake here is top notch and perfect for sipping. Accompany it with a Japanese beer to sip on as well and you're in for a great evening! Thanks for a wonderful Friday night Roka Akor. I can't wait to visit again!"

Well, as luck would have it, I've started to enjoy beer again (take that, 21st birthday!) and I met someone from Tenaya Creek at a Yelp event at Whole Foods.  His name escapes me, but he was super friendly and gave us a couple samples to try.  Despite being darker beer, I liked it!  I was now convinced I needed to make a visit to Tenaya Creek.I've now been twice and I really fell for the place.  There's nothing special about the bar - just your standard bar with a few places outside to sit.  There's a pool table, a couple video games, some TV's playing sports, and windows looking out to the brewery.  But what this place lacks for in style, it makes up in every other way possible.The bartenders are the friendliest I've met.  They introduce themselves to you and ask your name when you come in (!) and they are happy to have a conversation with you instead of amongst themselves.  The other customers are friendly too and one guy even ran to the door to hold it open for me when my hands were full (!!).  It's a small-town feel despite being in the middle of Las Vegas.The prices are amazing - $3 for 16 ounce or $4 for 20 ounce.  I'm not sure if that's happy hour pricing, but I didn't see any advertisements for a happy hour.  When the bartender said our tab was $6 for two beers, I literally yelled ""What?!"" in front of a bunch of people.  I might have made a bit of a scene....The best part about this place is that every beer I've tried, I've liked.  This amazes me to no end.  There's no food to be had and choices nearby are slim.  But on my last visit they invited Sausagefest to their parking lot and they had some awesome vegan sausages I got to try!  I'm so close to giving them five stars, but the ambience of the place is keeping me from doing it.  I want a bar to be a little dark (theirs is pretty open and bright) and have some interesting dÌ©cor or seating or something to make me want to stick around a little longer.  You know, a nice place for me and my husband to grab a couple of drinks and hang out for a while.  If you're more interested in meeting some new, friendly people in a open bar then this is definitely a five star place.I was told at the Yelp event that they offer brewery tours and I'm looking forward to doing one soon.  Call ahead to schedule."

I brought some of my foster kids here a couple days ago and it really seemed to cure their depression. They really enjoyed playing with the Dairy Cow, and picking up the hens. The moment I got out of my car I was greeted by a variety of different colored kittens and two adult cats. One cat in particular, took a liking to me and tried to follow me home.  When I opened my car door, she hopped in and wouldn't get out.  The cats, bunnies and chickens all live together in harmony. I have never seen anything like this. One of the nicest things I saw was a cat taking care of a baby chick who wandered away from it's mom. She carried the baby chick back to her mom. Mom hen wasn't very thankful, but I don't think the cat minded.They actually have a Flemish Giant here that weights over 20lbs and is bigger than most dogs. And, it loves attention! This is the only place in Clark County where you can buy fresh duck eggs. You can buy duck eggs at the Filipino Markets, but those have those fetuses inside them. If you want a fresh duck egg with no dead baby in it, come over here instead.  For those of you who don't know, the duck egg is a far superior baking egg. You can also buy organic chicken eggs here. They are the brown variety, and they taste really great.  Remember that organic eggs don't have steroids in them like store eggs. The chicken who laid them eats only all-natural feed, and she lays the eggs on her own time instead of being forced. Therefore, the egg itself is larger and tastes much different. These eggs are also fertile, so if you want a pet chick you can actually hatch them. The White peafowl is a very rare species of Peafowl and many people believe that it is good luck when you have the rare privilege to see one.  Unfortunately, there were like over 100 of them here and I don't feel any luckier.  The White Peahen recently laid a ton of eggs, so we might be seeing baby white peafowls soon. In the last few weeks, I've learned that cows actually have facial recognition. I brought some food for the two dairy cows a few weeks ago, and since then they have remembered me each time. Every time they see me now, they get extremely excited. These cows love being massaged and they are very gentle. But, don't wear expensive clothing because they will lick you all over. And a cow's tongue feels like sandpaper. I also had no idea that cows only had teeth on the bottom of their jaws until today when Hazel the dairy cow inhaled my whole arm when I was feeding her. http://youtu.be/1d__kK7lw7AIf you like seeing kittens, baby rabbits, baby tortoises, and baby chickens all playing together in peace, you might really like this place.  But, just to let you know... this place does not have slot machines and black jack.  Please don't forget to leave a donation. This place does not charge an admission fee, and the farmer spends over $3000 a week on feed for the animals. The decent thing to do is leave at least something even if it's small. Last time I was here I saw this douche bag husband and wife come in here, take a million pictures, chase and scare the animals, and leave without buying anything or leaving a donation.  I know most NW Vegas locals are broke from their gambling addictions, but that's taking it too far.  You don't have to have young children to come here.  I'm a guy in my mid 20s, and most my foster kids are preteens, but the workers here are always  happy to see us.  Important piece of information: This place is only open on the weekends. I wish I could give this place 100 stars."

Caveat can be found in the food section below.I was here for a company group dinner last night and would have to say that I was a nice experience.Ambiance: being on the penthouse level of downtown Charlotte, this restaurant has (I think) a 360 degrees view of the city. Just magnificent and romantic.Service: along with the top prices you pay here, the services is TOP NOTCH, which I would say that I'm quite impressed with the wait staff. Just very professional and very polite which positively contributed to my overall experience.Food:  I would have given this restaurant 5 stars if I my meat would have been done right. Let's break it down:Apps: shrimp cocktail was fantastic. The shrimps were humongous and my colleague really liked them. I did not try them myself.Tuna carpaccio: I thought this was pretty good.Escargot: omg so delicious on the tiny toast!  Very nicely seasoned with garlic and herbs. I really have enjoyed this dish.Fried calamari: OOOMMMGGG! Best fried calamari EVER! You have not lived until you've tried this calamari! Well if you're a calamari person. I called this fried calamari steaks! Lol. Cut into thick slices and delicately breaded and seasoned, they were fried to a perfect consistency. The slices of sliced calamari were perfectly cooked, juicy and melt-in-your-mouth tender. Just absolutely amazing! the aioli was just phenomenal!Side salad: standard salad but the balsamic dressing was way to acidic for my taste.Entree:Bourbon filet mignon: I didn't eat this but my colleague told me that this was very good. Mixed grille: I was a little disappointed with this dish... The mixed grill included 3 different meats: lamb, bison, and filet. The lamb was fantastic! The filet was a little too salty and over cooked (medium instead of medium rare) and the bison hanger steak was cooked correctly but lacked flavor. I was surprised how lean the bison hanger steak was, and I thought it lacked flavor. The red wine reduction was too salty.  The bamboo rice was very good.Bananas fosters saves the day!For dessert, I shared a bananas foster with my colleague and we were all pining for more!!! It was a show and a desert because they prepared it table side and we can smell the caramelizing sugar while the waiter prepared it. I would have licked the bowl if I was alone! LolOverall, very good restaurant and had the prices to match it. However next time I will  order fish instead of the steaks."

You have seven different choices to choose from here is the list:1. Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood2. Le Village Buffet at Paris3. The Flavors at Harrah's4. Carnival World Buffet at Rio5. Village Seafood Buffet at Rio (Additional $15)6. Emperor's Buffet at Imperial Palace7. Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace (Additional $15) *RECOMMENDED!!!*Definitely recommend getting your total rewards card to save you a few bucks here and there. (21 and over) You get exactly 24 hours from the purchase time. I would suggest to get it at around 7 or 8 at night so you get two dinners, breakfast and a lunch all for $45 excluding the additional $15 if you are willing to pay more for higher quality of food. Just know that the lines are crazy on the weekends so be prepared to wait or pay extra $10 to basically cut in line to go to the front. Note: Recommend to bring a few bucks with you for tips. Also, make sure to have a small group before you are waiting in line for an hour or two just for a table."

It is not a luxurious resort as a Ritz, but it is very clean and offers a lot of space and amenities.  Being in Phoenix in mid-June, we really needed an indoor pool.  It is a unique indoor/outdoor pool.  Not huge, but every day it was just myself and the boys in the pool.  The hotel offers a full breakfast  - hot items like eggs, waffles, oatmeal, etc and cold items like cereal, yogurt, fruit, juice, milk, etc.  At night they have a free reception - basically a free dinner.  Every evening, there is a basic salad, fresh cut veggies, a soup, chips, nachos, hot dogs, baked potato, pasta with sauce and meatballs.  Plus, you have unlimited soft drinks. It is a great value!Our room is a large 2 room with small separate kitchen with table, chairs, sink, fridge, micro and large counter.  Living room has a pullout sofa, desk w/chair and large tv.  Private bedroom is large with 2 queen beds and large tv - plus a large bathroom.  Free wireless internet in the room with plenty of tv channels to choose from.  It is perfect for a family or business travel.Every worker that I have come across is very friendly and helpful.  I read another review that stated the hotel was not very clean...during our stay, the hotel (our room and all the public rooms) were very clean.  I am a neat freak and it looks like it is constantly being kept up.  All in all, very happy with our choice and I would stay here again!"

We made reservations for the lounge for 7 people. The staff was very accommodating and worked to keep you happy. Their lounge menu has something for everyone at great prices. We had numerous orders of their sliders (veggie and meat filled), very tasty! Their miso soup is probably the best I have had. I dream of their butterfish tataki and we got many of the folks in our party raving as well. The cocktails are hard to beat. The scene, ambiance, service and quality of food is top notch! I enjoy going as a solo diner for happy hour and the occasional Sunday brunch.

The place is a dive and was pretty much as expected after reading the reviews. It was clean and the servers were friendly and helpful. We decided to try the combos and that was a good choice. There was plenty of food and it was very fresh and cooked properly. The salsa was very flavorful but a bit mild so we asked for some hotter salsa. The waitress mixed some of the Habanera in with it and it was perfect. Their Chili Rellinos were some of the best I have had. Overall it was a nice meal and I would recommend their food to anyone just realize the place is very divey but overall enjoyable.

A perfect condo type hotel located just 1 block from the strip. It was nice to stay at somewhere quiet and smoke-free, yet just a short walk to all the hustle and bustle. It was nice having a choice of the laid back Signature pools or going to the MGM pools and lazy river. If we wanted to eat out, there were plenty of choices in the MGM. We loved Diegos. We ate there 2 times and had their Sangria 4 days in a row!We stayed 2 nights in a junior suite without a balcony. It was nice and we had a great view of the strip. The bathroom was very large with a jacuzzi tub and separate shower.  While we did want to have a kitchen, we didn't like how it was situated right in the center of the room. There wasn't storage space for all of our non refrigerated items, so they had to be kept out on the counter, which cluttered the room. Not a huge deal though.We did end up upgrading to a 1 bedroom suite for the last 2 nights. What a difference! We loved our room. We had a balcony overlooking the MGM pools and Wet Republic. There was 1 bathroom with a shower and a huge bathroom in the bedroom.  This room had a ""full"" kitchen with a regular size sub-zero fridge and oven... It was a huge help being able to go to the grocery store and stock up on food for all of us. It saved us money and time. When the kids were too tired to go out to eat, all we had to do was cook something easy for them in the room. We were able to eat healthier also.There is an Albertsons just up Tropicana over the 15 freeway. You will see it on your left hand side. It might be 10 minutes or so away. There is also an In-n-Out up Tropicana also just as you pass over the 15. It's on the right hand side. Much more space to store things, as well as tons of space in the suite to store bags, clothing, etc..One night we had 5 adults and 8 kids over and we had plenty of room. There is even a washer/dryer in the unit.. The kids loved the t.v. that slides up from inside the desk in the master bedroom. We will definitely stay here whenever we come into town with our kids."

Completely renovated, it is now the cleanest joint in chinatown, from the dining room to the toilets, it's all modern and clean.The menu is similar to its sister restaurant KanBai on Ste-Satherine, szechuan cuisine with some Hunan and Cantonese thrown in there for good measure.We ordered seven dishes for 6 ppl, and couldn't finish everything, comes out to 21$ per person and that's a damn good deal!!! plus I ate so well. I would say the chef here is better than at the Ste-cat location, same dishes better taste!!We ordered shrimp, cabbage, calamari, tofu and eggplant, bamboo stew, fish in hot broth and beef soup.The soup came out first, it's chopped beef in egg drop style soup, it's light and subtle, save some for later you will need it. Often the dishes wil be oily and sipping some soup on the side will help balance out the too much oil feeling.The shrimp was very good, it's stir fried in soy sauce and sugar, and the sugar caramelizes the shrimps. It is shrimp with the shell on, so be warned. I like the shell on, gives it more flavor, but that's an acquired taste. The dish is on the sweet side, but with a bit of rice and soup it goes well.The bamboo shoots are different, they are not the kind you get at the supermarket, and it comes in a mini wok over a flame so it's keeps warm, very good dish. The bamboo shoots are springy and woody so they are fun to chew, and the flavor is very well balanced, tasty.Calamari and tofu eggplant are standard fare, still very good though, but the stand out discovery of the night was the cabbage!!! It's so simple I would never order this, but my friend did and boy am I glad he did.It's just cabbage stir fried with some salt, light brown sauce, and hot peppers, and some other secret powder ingredients. Eventhough it has peppers in the dish it's not spicy at all, and the cabbage looks plain stir fried but when you eat it, it is somehow infused with so much flavor.I'm happy :)"

I always start with the Caprese Salad or Anti Pasta platter, either way I get that amazing fresh mozzarella that dances across the old taste buds that can't be described in a PG rated review.They have done something to maintain the same consistent crust you won't find anybody else doing. They have a special tap that creates ""Brooklyn water"" specifically and only for the crust.

From a grocery store/sit down store? A place called Haji-Baba? On Apache and McClintock? What? Surely you can't blame me for doubting his convictions. One day we finally went in. I looked at the menu full of foreign foods and was overtaken by fear. ""What is all of this shit?"", I thought to myself. Of course, this was just a sign of how uncultured I was (and still am). Luckily, my friend took the work out of deciphering the menu and ordered a gyro for me. We got it to go. I opened up my gyro and saw huge chunks of meat. You know those places that have gyros with thin, insulting, child sized strips of meat? Yeah, this isn't one of those places. This is a gyro for a grown man. So, good start, right? I took a bite. It was... amazing. Their feta cheese, onions, and meat combined for one of the best foods I have ever tasted to this day. It was messy, juicy, the meat was packed so thick that it was difficult to eat (all positive notes), and wow, it was just brilliant. You know that feeling you get when you walk into BevMo for the first time and realize you're in alcohol heaven? When you realize you've stumbled upon something special and that you'll be back again and again? Yeah, that's the feeling.I ate at Haji Baba's again the next day. And about twice every week for a month afterwards. Later I learned that their ""Deluxe"" gyro is even better. I also discovered that they have some kickass foods in there. Special mention goes out to the chocolates..Unfortunately, I still haven't tried anything else on the menu. This is probably a result of a combination of me being terrified of the menu due to having no idea what those other foods are, and me internally weighing out the risk of eating an average or only above-average food as compared to eating one of my favorite food items in existence. Easy choice.I've never sat down to eat at Haji-Baba, but when getting the food to go there has never been a problem. The workers are friendly enough for satisfaction without being friendly to the point of irritation or perceived pretentiousness. There's also never a line and it's $3-4 for a Gyro. God damn I love this place."

I met him and some other Yelpers to sample some of Al-Hana's wares and while there were a few strike-outs (specifically, the hummus, which didn't have enough garlic or lemon, and the tabloulleh, which had way too much parsley), the falafel sandwich, shwarma beef and chicken sandwiches (both with garlic sauce), and cheese pies were all so flavorful! And at $2.99 and $3.99 for the sandwiches and $.50 - $3.99 for the other sides, the lunch was also incredibly affordable. If you are ever in the area or work or live nearby, you should definitely check Al-Hana out. Given how affordable it is, you can have a savory and enjoyable lunch that really fills you up. If you have time after you finish eating, definitely take a few minutes to walk around the market - there are some real deals on Mediterranean staples, like 2-lb bags of dates for $3.99! One final note - there is a $10 minimum for debit/credit card usage, so bring cash."

You let him shoot firearms that he wouldn't be able to have back home!We were picked up by 2 men in camo gear in a huge Humvee! Pretty cool! When we arrived, there were people taking pics in another Humvee with what looked like a .50 caliber M2 heavy machine gun on it's roof! Of course hubby had to take a pic! Our driver waited patiently for us to finish before he took us inside to give us further instructions.We went inside and up to the cashier to pay for hubby's package. I was surprised at the huge selection of firearms he had to choose from. He picked the Iwo Jima package and we waited to be called to the range in the back. We perused the many souvenirs to choose from and it wasn't long before we were called.  Our guide looked young but was very knowledgeable and friendly. He was very firm about the rules before we entered the firing range but we had been to firing ranges before and had no problem following directions when it came to safety.  The first gun used was a Springfield 1911. Hubby had not problem handling, loading and firing as evident by the holes in the the targets abdominal area. Bullets flew from the gun and littered the floor only to be swept up to prevent accidental slips. Next came the M2 Carbine. That's when the hits started to fan out, just a little from the center. Hubby held his own with this semi-automatic. It was cute seeing his big grin after shooting that gun. There was a moment where everyone had to cease fire so a guide could fix a stuck line that held his shooter's target. Everyone put their firearms down and stood against the wall until it was clear to resume shooting. They were not messing around with safety and I appreciated that. It gave hubby some time to ask firearm questions.Last but not least was the Thompson. This was the gun hubby was looking forward to shooting. Fully automatic, it wasn't long before he ran out of ammo, but that kept his adrenaline going for the rest of the day. When we left the firing area, we were able to remove our protective gear and look at other selections. The staff here were very helpful, knowledgable and friendly. I would recommend this place for anyone interested in learning how to properly handle any firearem!"

It's not cheap, so don't expect it to be.  The Foundation Room has become my new favorite weekend dance club.  Despite $5 waters and $9 ""cheap"" beers, the music makes it worth it.  Admission is expensive, and unless you're either a) female - and can get $10 passes wandering through Mandalay Bay, or b) willing to grease the hand of the doorman (then he may give you his card and you can get this $10 priority admission for your local crew), you'll likely be asked for $30 at the door.As a ""local lady"" in this town I can generally get into most clubs for free, but it's worth it to me to pay the $10 and go to the Foundation Room for our girls nights out.   The most compelling reason is THE MUSIC.  The DJ generally plays a great mix of hip hop, dance, and rock music from the 80's through today.  The variation is welcome compared to most clubs only playing the most contemporary music (regardless of the quality).  Second, the volume of the music keeps bringing us back!  You can actually hear each other talk in this club!  There's no doubt the volume is loud enough to get lost in if you wish, but even inside you can still understand what people are saying to you and ask your friends what they'd like to drink and hear the responses.  Plus, if you want a break from the boom-boom, just step outside on the balcony.  That brings us to the third plus, the balcony!  A smashing view of the Las Vegas Strip from the southern tip looking north.  If you're lucky enough to be there on a stormy summer night I highly recommend watching the lightening float across the clouds and crash on the surrounding Vegas mountains.Of course there are drawbacks.  Drinks are expensive, and if you're not a rich looking guy the female bartenders will mostly ignore you.  The crowd seems to vary from spry young things to middle age male gawkers.  But, it's Vegas, what do you expect?  I've never found a lack of interesting people to talk to, and I welcome that I can actually hear what they're saying while booty-shakin' to some hip-hop that brings back college memories."

Aka, bikini tops/bottoms, tankinis and midriffs are not allowed. The host will probably tell you to go back to your room and change. Okay, now to my review of my overall experience.We got to the restaurant on a Sunday at around 12pm to have brunch. Like a boss, we were seated within five minutes of arriving. ***DISCLAIMER: THERE ARE NO BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS HERE.*** Kind of the first thing I look for when I go to any Sunday brunch, nowadays. Don't worry, I don't have a problem.Chocolate croissant: Flakiest chocolate croissant I've ever had with slivers of almond and a drizzle of chocolate on top. Absolutely perfect.Raspberry beignets: Not my favorite of the selection because the raspberry jam within the beignet was too sweet and the entire thing was just coated with sugar, so too sweet for my taste, but hey, who's to say this won't be the perfect fancy donut hole for some other brunch go-er.Steak Frites: Those frites tho. They are probably the best I've ever had. Next to anything with truffle oil on them. So, take note, Bouchon, I like truffle fries as much as the next person. Can I get an 'amen?' Steak was cooked perfectly and covered with onions. Now, if you're weird like me and don't like the taste of the onions, then refrain, refrain, refrain from ordering this. Or you can ask them to omit the onions, but I'd rather get the food the way that it's supposed to come. Chicken and Waffles: Bacon, bacon and bacon. Whaaat? Yeah. If you're looking for greasy fried chicken, you're not gonna get it with their version. It is a roasted half chicken with a side of chive waffles. And you guessed it, there's also bits of bacon in the chive waffles. Also comes with a side of gravy that comes with plenty of, you guessed it again, bacon. I was halfway expecting the maple syrup to be bacon infused. But I didn't even use the maple syrup, so I guess I'll never know. The chicken was moist, the skin slightly charred and the gravy added the perfect saltiness that the chicken needed. The waffles were a perfect balance of sweet and salty. I, also, ordered a coffee, which they kept filling and piping hot. The overall experience was great. I have no complaints. The service is the best. Make sure you ask to sit in Adam's section."

Kevin came out right away for an estimate.  I like to be thorough so I told him I had a few other estimates scheduled before I would make a decision.  I should've just set up the installation right away as Kevin had everyone beat without having to price match.  He was also very thorough in explaining the differences in 80% vs 90%, quoting actual statistics in one vs the other.I called Kevin to proceed with his bid and he came out the next day to do our upstairs measurements (which he offered to do the first time, but I wanted to wait on the other estimates).  The screens were ready on the weekend and he offered to come out either Saturday or Monday.  We opted for Saturday and he came right out and wrapped up installation in no time.A week later and we're very happy with the sunscreens.  Definitely a major improvement.  I'm glad I came across Express Solar Protection on Yelp.  I'll probably end up having our South windows done next year."

It deserves it.I haven't tried every coffee shop in Edinburgh but I'd still be confident in saying none are better than Brew Lab.The interior is well polished; stylish and modern but still very warm and comfortable.The staff are polite, charming and relaxed. They are obviously very talented baristas, whose knowledge and passion for coffee is obvious.Coffee is the main draw of Brew Lab. The reason being that they source and frequently rotate the best beans from the best roasters in Europe. A considerable amount of effort (and cost) has obviously been invested in using the top of the range equipment to brew in a variety of ways, getting the best out of the beans. Best of all, I've been able to enjoy a huge selection of wonderful, different flavours and blends that would simply have not been available elsewhere in town.The food is also of an equal quality. Serving fresh Union of Genius soups daily, freshly baked baguettes with ever-changing, creative and fresh fillings. Always offering a vegetarian or vegan option as well. I realised I used the word 'fresh' far too much in that sentence but it is a word that seems to perfectly describe Brew Lab, figuratively and literally.It's a credit to Edinburgh."

I pulled up the map, but for some reason, my directionally impaired self thought it was not as far down on Spring Mountain as it is.One night, while driving my fella to work, I spotted it!  The holy grail!  If I could have dropped him off just an hour and a half earlier, I could have stopped, since they are open til midnight on weekdays, but alas, the 2-10 am shift sucks, and I don't leave the house til 1:30am.So.  Yesterday, fella and I went to a park for Ife's birthday, and almost melted outside.  Driving home, fella says...""Didn't you want to try an ice cream place, or something?""I love this man...he just gets my need and love for dessert.  We parked, and walked in to a packed little place, with seating on one wall, completely full. The girls behind the counter were personable and asked if we'd been in before.  When we said we hadn't, she asked if we'd had snow before, and we said no.  So, she educated us about this delightful treat.We ordered, and decided to keep it simple for the first go:  plain strawberry for my fella, and green tea snow with sweetened condensed milk on top for me.I can't even describe the texture of this treat.  A sign on the wall says that shaved snow is what happens when shaved ice and ice cream meet and have a baby. (or something close to that.)That's a pretty accurate description.  It has a creamy texture, but is light, and looks like little sheets of tissue paper!  So good.I will absolutely be back, to try other flavors, and to try some more of the toppings too.My only issues are:1.  It was REALLY warm in there.  I mean...its 111 degrees outside, and you're selling shaved snow...it should feel a little cooler inside.2.  The sizes are ridiculous.  PORTION CONTROL people!  The small was enormous.  I'm going to have to inquire if they have a ""child size"" cup, because even being as light as this was, it was still way too much."

It is one of my favorite Big Burrito restaurants as well, along with Umi and Casbah. I love the urban, upscale feel of the restaurant. It isn't pretentious, and everything from the decor to the flatware is tasteful and elegant. My husband and I most recently came here to celebrate our anniversary, and we weren't disappointed.I started with a glass a of the pinot blanc/pinot gris blend from Alsace (one of my favorite regions for white wines in the entire universe), and it was delicious. They had a good wine list, which is one of my favorite things about Eleven.I started with the tuna tartare, which was delicious. It kept with tradition, while still being inventive and fresh. I loved the caviar on top! I had the seafood tasting this time around because I was feeling indecisive, and it was lovely to be able to try a little bit of several things. The portion size was perfectly adequate for me, but then, I don't like feeling overly stuffed when I leave a restaurant. The salmon was cooked well (there is nothing worse than overcooked salmon), and the scallop and crabcake were delicious. My husband had the pork chop, and the glazed beets in the dish were outstanding.Next time, I look forward to exploring some of Eleven's cocktails options as well as more of the menu items."

I can't believe I've never reviewed it before...  Anyway, it's right in front of Sushi Mon, my favorite sushi place, and is part of the Japanese one-two punch on Silverado and Maryland.It's a small shop carrying Japanese items of many different types.  I'd break it down into three main types:  1)  Anime, Manga, and Novelty items:  This is where all the Japanese fan boys go to find soundtracks, DVDs, figurines, Keyblade and Gunblade models, Cosplay parts, and Hello Kitty erasers.  Having some of that in me, I enjoy this part a lot. 2)  Japanese Home Items:  This includes lots of plates, bathroom items, sake bottles, tea cups, hair dye, shampoo, shoe horns, strainers, lamps, home decor, and other such things.  I mainly use some of the tea accessories, and have recently bought dishes and bowls.3)  Food!:  This is mainly Japanese packed food.  This includes things like Pocky, packaged candy, biscuits, cookies, Melon soda, Mochi Ice Cream, packaged teas, pastries, and the like.  This is what I get here *every* time I come.  It's all so delicious!Another thing you have to know about Tokyo Discount is that they really are discount.  Everything is cheap!  Get t-shirts for $5, and sodas for $1, whole china sets for under $20, facial products cheaper than Wal-mart, and you simply can't beat the prices on import CDs and DVDs (most, but not all).  Staff is friendly and helpful, as well.  Go see May, she's the best!"

There were three small flat screens spread throughout the walls of the dining room on various sports channels, so that was a plus for me since I'm a huge sports fan.The service was excellent. Our waiter was very nice and friendly. She was attentive to when we needed drink refills and took it upon herself to give us refills before we had to ask. I had the stromboli and my coworker had the chicken fingers. Not the best stromboli I've ever had (that honor goes to Four Kegs), but it was really good. The portion size was good, and came with a side of marinara for dipping. The chef also came out to ask us how the food was. I thought that was a nice touch.The prices were fairly reasonable, but we used Groupon Now vouchers, so it ended up being a great deal. They had no problem with us using two vouchers for one table.

I was very impressed by their training. I was pleased that they had a very nice selection of TB shoes available (boots, lots of Reva flats, heels, sandals and wedges.) So many styles to choose from. The sales associate assisting me was very courteous and knowledgeable about their products. I left with several pairs and a cute little Amanda purse. I love my wedges. I will definitely be back."

I have very fond memories of going here with my family around the holidays. There's something so perfect about eating in this narrow, cozy kitchen hidden in an alley. It's always loud in a good way, and the service is usually great in a no-nonsense kinda way. The owners are usually milling about to check on you and make you feel at home. I'm all about the ambiance at this place -- it makes me feel like I'm back in Italy.The food is also consistently great. Their sangaweeches -- sandwiches of Italian meats, cheeses, and greens wrapped in freshly baked pizza dough like an Italian taco --  are always delicious. They have wholesome soups in the winter and excellent giant salads full of nuts and berries and cheese.Though I've never gotten the chance to drink it, I know they get rave reviews on their wine. I have, however, tried their baked goods sold in the store upfront. I've had some of the best cookies and macaroons of my life from this bakery. Anything with chocolate is a must.I cannot recommend this place enough -- if you're in the strip district and you need a quick, hearty, AWESOME lunch, this is your place. Trust me."

My favorites are the beignets, pork belly, and truffle fries for starters. Trust me, you will perk up instantly with these. I never pass up the mussels because they know how to seduce me with the leeks, rosemary and garlic fries. I will almost loose my ladylike composure and pick up the hot pot to drink up the sauce. It's that frickin fantastic. My fave dinner item is the duck breast. Fatty goodness with black truffle. How does one go wrong with that? Your wallet might cringe but then I guess that depends on how you value self investment. I'm all about the return and this place is a sure thing for me.

It's very convenient to the strip, but without the noise and crowds of most casinos. I was visiting friends to celebrate my birthday and they even loved the room. I'm a shower guy but the tub was so lovely that I had to soak in it for a while. I experienced great service while there and I also had a great view of the strip from my window. I chose this hotel based on it having no casino, but it definitely has a lot more going for it. I was busy out with friends and celebrating so I didn't take advantage of all the amenities but what I did get to partake in was definitely up to par with expectations. Each night I was heading out, I'd see a lot of great looking people leaving or coming into their bar (I think). Seems to be convenient if you're traveling alone and no friends in town, a place to go grab a drink, flirt, and/or converse. There was nothing about it I didn't like, but the going up to go down when I wanted to leave was a bit weird. I'd definitely stay here again, and probably will when I head down to Vegas again this year."

This was the closest place to pop up on our way back to Arizona so we decided to stop by and give it a whirl.This place is by FAR the best Thai food that I have had in America so far. But that might not really be saying much as the rest of the places have been in Arizona. But there is no place in AZ that serve Isaan food and mm mm mmmm I have missed me some Isaan food. Seeing as how both of us have not had Isaan food since we were last in Thailand, we decided to splurge a little and ended up with a $90 bill between the two of us. I'm going to just reiterate that every single dish we ordered was the best that we've had in the states.We started out with some Moo Dad Deaw (Issan Style Pork Jerky) This was one of my favorite dishes in Thailand and I was just beyond ecstatic when I finally found in a restaurant here. Som Tum (papaya salad) with some sticky rice to dip it in was next. It was funny to us when the waitress came by and was like ""Oh you eat just like Thai style!"" Tip. Try it. Soaking up the Som Tum juice with the sticky rice is oh so delicious. Again I find it hard to find a place that serves a good Som Tum AND have the sticky rice available so I was extremely excited. We also ordered the Tom Yum Kai soup to start out with too and it absolutely hit the spot. Then we finally reached our main courses. We decided on getting the Khao Soi and the Northern Larb. These are both Isaan (Northern region) style food that we have found impossible to find in Arizona. I'm not going to lie, the larb absolutely kicked my ass. But it usually does everywhere I have it. The dish was amazing yet I have forgotten how hot Isaan spicy really is. The Khao Soi is a noodle curry dish that is absolutely divine. I don't think that you really find this combination too much so I was glad to finally have it again.I can't wait to come back already to get some of the other dishes that I have been searching to no avail for. People might go to Vegas for gambling but I am coming back for the Thai food. It might not save me any money but it will absolutely be worth it.The only weird part of the experience might have been the fact that there was a empty table next to us the entire time. The place was hopping, the waiting parties at the bar were getting to be ridiculous, yet there was a table for four right next to us that was left empty. Now we had a couple theories for this. A. It might have been because we smelled. Everybody was in their Night out getups and here we were in shorts and a tshirt covered with a couple layers of dirt. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a certain odor permeating around us. B. We had spicy food. This entails me sweating like a pig. A + B probably meant nobody wanted to be within a 10 ft radius of me. I will try to clean up for next time..."

Now that I have your attention, please kindly direct your gaze upon an otherwise non-descript strip center in the west valley.  On the southeast corner of 59th Ave and Union Hills lies Oscar's.  It's small restaurant with an interior that somewhat closely resembles a seafood shack setup you'd expect to find along the shores of New England.  Simple wooden seating, photos and fishing emblems all over the walls, and oh yeah, dynamite seafood.  I had been looking for a new lunch spot to try during the work day and it just so happens Yelpers were giving this place solid marks for the food and especially for Ron, the owner.  When I walked in this time, sure enough Ron was manning the register.  Super nice guy who is super passionate about his product.  Based on my experience it's easy to see why.When you come in, you order at the counter and grab a table as they bring the food out to you.  The place looks like it seats about 40-50 people including the outdoor patio.  Be warned, the menu is lengthy with a ton of different items to choose from.  Ron can recommend items depending on your taste.  And if you're a regular, chances are Ron remembers what you like as he was naming off customer's favorite dishes in succession.  The place was about half full the whole time I was there with people steadily streaming in and out.  I just got a small table near the register since it was just me by myself this time.I had done my research in advance and decided to go with one of their big feature dishes.  A crab stuffed salmon dish with sides of crab pasta salad and mixed veggies.  They have a 10% Yelp check in discount you can apply to your meal.  Total price for the meal plus drink after the discount was about $17.  My meal came out in about 10 minutes.  I believe most of their dishes take less time, but mine is probably among the more complex on their menu.Ron enthusiastically brought it out to my table.  Looked and smelled heavenly (see my photo).  First off, let me praise Ron on the crab pasta salad.  They did not skimp on the crab with this.  I was able to get my fork on nice big chunks of rich crab (and even some shrimp) with every bite.  The cooked veggies were prepared very simple.  A little salt and pepper and include green beans, squash, and zucchini.  And of course, the main event.  The salmon.  A nice fillet with a line of crab stuffed in the middle from top to bottom.  Fantastic texture mixing the gentle subtle flavor of the salmon with the richness of the crab.  Seriously, I think this might be the best way I've ever seen salmon presented.  I pretty much crushed my meal in record time.  I was plenty full and happy when all was said and done.As I mentioned earlier, most of their dishes come out pretty quick and the prices for most of their dishes looked to be around $10.  They also have specials on a regular basis (today they had a grilled swordfish special).  They also have a decent selection of beers and wines to choose from at the front (as well as plenty of soft drink choices).  This place would definitely work as a lunch or dinner spot for sure.  Big time props to you Ron.  You hit it out of the park on my first visit here.  It certainly won't be my last, though it might take me awhile to try everything on the menu.  Or I might just dominate that salmon again.  Either way it's a win-win."

But if you're gonna be sick enough to be in the hospital, this is the hospital you want to be in.Flashback a couple months, when I had a high fever with some odd symptoms (blue splotchy skin?).  My doc took one look at me and told me to go straight to the E.R.So of course I didn't. I went home, packed a little bag w/ a few essentials, and thought about where I might want to be stuck for 2 or 3 nights (cuz I knew I was going to be admitted). Although I've been a patient w/ excellent care at St. Joes, I selected Scottsdale Shea because it was so nice when I had a 3 day stay after surgery a few years back, and the E.R. wasn't as busy (you can see wait times for their E.R. at http://fastertimes.org/ )I get there a couple hours later, they triage me fast, and after about 30 minutes in waiting area, they got me back to E.R. Quickly looked me over, brought in the right people, tests ordered, fast process overall and in 2.5 hours I was in my own room.13 days, folks. That's how long I was there.  That's a long time (to me, anyway). EVERYONE who cared for me was awesome- the nursing staff (RNs, NAs)  was attentive, competent, friendly, never waited for any meds.  If something was wrong, they listened and took me seriously and followed through with testing, etc.  My treatment was explained to me by the several doctors that were following my case.  In addition, I had much of the same staff again and again, so that really helped.Other details: my room was very clean, the nursing staff did their best to protect my sleeping (no throwing on bright lights, etc). Food: you do get to select/order your own food unless you have some special restriction in place. Food is OK for say, 2-3 days, but after that I was done w/ boring Aramark hospital food. The quality was fine, but let's face it, it's hospital food and they aren't a restaurant. So if your stay is going to be longer than a couple days, prepare a visitor or two to bring you in something from ""the outside""."

I have to say that I continue to be impressed by the consistently good quality and reasonably priced food.  My favorite is the chicken salad with house (tomatillo) dressing - hard to order anything else.  Their flour tortillas are wonderful.  The portions of ingredients in the salad are generous and if I separate things into multiple containers (to keep the cooked stuff from wilting the lettuce) as soon as I get home, I can usually get 3 meals out of just one Cafe Rio chicken salad.  This is literally the only place I have ever completed a frequent buyer card - and I have completed quite a few over the years.   I normally choose mom an pop places over either fast food or any chain restaurants, but I make an exception for this one.  I like that if I'm hungry when I walk in the door, even with a line of people, I can be seated and eating in about five minutes.  I give five stars for combination of value for the money, good tasting food, friendly employees, and upbeat atmosphere."

This is a great place for vegetarians as well since they use Quorn and faux ground beef.  My veggie oggie was almost indistinguishable in taste from a regular oggie.  Dessert is also excellent.  I've had the apple caramel pasty and it was the perfect way to end our meal.This is a must-eat-at restaurant.

When I was a young sprog in 1st and 2nd year, my outside subject was history of art. Every week we would have to meet in small groups and discuss the art as well as present on it in the gallery. As my class was 10am, we would all meet outside the gallery at 9.30 and sat in the sun. Bliss!These galleries are brilliant. They have amazing exhibitions, such as andy Warhol, Monet, Manet and much more. As well visiting artists they have a really strong collection. If you're into art at all then I thoroughly recommend these galleries.  If you don't fancy paying to get in, the gallery at the back is free. Top tip!"

Right away, the staff made our birthday guest feel special with her preference of seating (table 4- indoors with sunset views) and a birthday card from the restaurant. Our server, I think her name was Dolores, spoke with a French accent, which made the birthday experience even fatter for a 12 year old girl who had never climbed past Olive Garden fancy up til tonight. Dolores(?) answered all the questions the 2 younger guests had, such as what's Jidori mean? What is foie gras? And is pork belly really just bacon?We started off the meal with the complimentary bread basket (chile corn bread, and the most awesome ancho flatbread) and some calamari. Calamari is supposed to be tender and not rubbery and this was perfectly cooked.The menu changes seasonally at Lon's and we all decided that we were going to go for something hearty, so it was sea bass, pork duo and the Jidori chicken. Our server said the chicken was a half-bird, so two of us split that entree (which the staff accomplished at our table without a sidewards glance) and because the goat cheese mac n cheese is a requirement here, we ordered a side of that. With 2 glasses of wine, an appetizer and 3 entrees, I spent $165 including the tip.The patrons at Lon's are mostly an older crowd, but it's a classy place with really delicious food and great service and a rustic atmosphere.

I know going in here that it isn't going to be clean, or quick, or easy to sort through the piles of material. When I shop for fabric, I'm only looking for knits (I make scarves out of super soft knits), which are located on the righthand side of the store near the back in a GIANT pile that is only haphazardly organized. Knits aren't sold in large quantities like most of the other fabric they have-they are mostly just small-ish pieces that almost all have holes or stains. You have to check the fabric yourself, because they won't do it for you when you go to have it measured. I'd say on average, most knits are between 1/2 yard to 3 yards in length that are in the pile of fabrics. The exception is the bins next to the knit piles, which typically have much smaller pieces of material and are usually irregularly shaped. I have found some great, super soft knits in these piles-think fabric that is used by James Perse, Ella Moss, Splendid...that's what these feel like. It requires a lot of digging to find usable amounts of material in the piles that are also hole- and stain-free, but it's worth it! Knits are only $1.99 a yard here, which is a phenomenal deal.They sell other fabrics that would be used for costumes, tons of sparkly fabrics, plus fleece, upholstery fabrics (though they don't sell upholstery thread), and a bunch of threads in different levels of quality/quantity. They do sell needles but they are behind the register, and you order them by telling them which number you want from the ""menu"" of smallish items. BEFORE YOU PAY AT THE REGISTER, you MUST have your fabric measured at one of the cutting stations-even if you don't plan to have the material cut! They measure it to figure out how much you are getting, then they make you a receipt and hold your material behind the register. When you are ready to pay, simply walk up with your receipt to the register and they'll calculate the total from your receipt and bring you your bag of fabric. They take most credit cards so I don't need to have cash here (it seems like the type of place where it would be cash-only, but thankfully it is not).Come here if you are prepared to spend time and effort finding the best and cheapest material around without all the glitz and glamour of a regular (i.e. chain) fabric store!"

He goes back to the kitchen and we hear the head chef get angry and started to yell at the waiter. The manager comes to our table apologize and pays for our appetizer. Great service!!

This past Saturday, on a whim, my family and some friends decided to go ""venture"" out to go on the Dolly Steamboat Dinner Cruise. Now at first I didn't want to go, thinking that it would be boring or an old-person kinda thing (sorry older folks), but I must say I was extremely pleasantly surprised.  The drive into Canyon Lake is and was breath-taking, surrounded by mountains on all sides, greenery, flowers, and then as you come over the last turn, you see the lake surrounded by the mountains -- it's so surreal, it's one of those ""pinch me, I must be dreaming"" kind of moments. We arrived and parked, and since we got there a bit early, we were able to enjoy the scenery from on the dock, which is gorgeous! When we were finally able to check in, we were a bit skeptical about sitting outside since it was still quite warm out, but we were assured we would love it -- and we did!!! I'm pretty sure we had the BEST seats in the house (aside from the captain, of course)! It was so peaceful and serene, and the temperature was perfect (actually even got a bit chilly as we were coming back). I have to say, the crew on the Dolly Steamboat -- Jeff (our Captain), Heather, and John -- definitely made our experience unforgettable! They were lively, bubbly, personable, friendly, and cracked jokes which made the cruise that much more fun. Our Captain, Jeff, made sure to point out the Bighorn Sheep (which was really a neat sight to see!), the vultures, shared interesting facts about the cruise itself, explained the caves, and told us other interesting facts as we cruised along. Heather and John were other crew members on the cruise that made it amazing! Our group pretty much made them our personal photographers since we took as many photos as we could before our cameras died, but they didn't seem to mind. Then came dinner... and OMGoodness was it amazing!!! I didn't think the food would be all that good but wow! The chefs cooked up some chicken (the most juicy piece of chicken I've EVER had in my life), pork (I don't eat pork but it looked and smelled divine), grilled veggies, and roasted potatoes, complete with salad first and dinner rolls. The food was soooo good that I ended up going back for seconds (after the crew members told us there was enough to go back for seconds if we wanted to... yes, I was totally being a fatty and eating as if it was my last meal). And then, just as I thought I couldn't possibly fit anymore food in my belly, Heather and John told us they were going to bring out dessert -- delicious blackberry cheesecake (so yummy, my mouth is watering just thinking about it). I sure didn't pass on the dessert... and it was well worth almost being rolled off the cruise for eating so much. We arrived back at the dock after dark which was great as we were able to see all the stars come out and could even see the Milky Way since it was so dark. The entire evening was perfect -- thank you Dolly Steamboat crew!!! The only thing I would've changed about the dinner cruise would've been to have my man with me and share the experience with him as well... But now that I know, I'll just have to surprise him and take him on a dinner cruise. It's definitely worth the money and the experience is unforgettable!!!"

Decided on The Moon and liked the place as soon as we walked in.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the beer selection and very friendly.  Wish I could remember his name.  We split a chicken sandwich and fries and it was very good.  I would like to give this a 5 star rating, but the servers who brought our food were kind of rude and it seemed like once we got our food, we were forgotten.  Other then that, we enjoyed everything else about visiting this restaurant."

For the sauce, I chose a combination of Alfredo sauce and pesto. Cheese: mozzarella and Parmesan. Meats: spicy sausage, pepperoni, and bacon. Veggies: spinach, mushrooms, red onions, pineapples, and sun dried tomatoes. The crust wasn't too thin or heavy. It was crunchy and soft at the same time. Hands down the best pizza I've ever had. I was pretty impressed with my creation. Lol. Leftovers was just as good!Service: Fast and friendly. The guy who assembled my pizza made suggestions when asked. My pizza came out within 5 minutes of ordering it! 11 inch pizza and bottled water for under $10. What a steal! Why go anywhere else for pizza?? Final thoughts: This is officially my favorite pizza spot! I loved everything about it! I was legit sad when I finished my leftovers. Lol."

The monorail is conveniently on the walk, so if you're heading to northern strip points, it's fine.This can get annoying, especially at night.  You have to go through the MGM basically - exiting through the entrance brings you to a long driveway down to Harmon (seemed sketchy with cars going pretty fast).I found the bottled water very cool.  Every staff member seems to be able to quickly access a fridge at it, at each tower and even the valets.Room was great with a balcony, kitchenette, and large bathroom (large tub with glass shower stall).*I stayed through one of the rental partners, Luxury Suites International, but the process works fine.  I'd assume the same for others, like Jet Luxury."

I learned a lot, about how beer is brewed, ingredients, how long it takes to make, how passionate the people at Joseph James are about their craft. I really like Joseph James Brewing Company, they create some really good tasting beer, cola, and root beer. The brewery is small but they're a local product that's available a lot of local or casino bars, local Whole Food Markets, Lee's Discount Liquor, some other grocery or liquor stores."

Starving and puzzled where to gorge myself and eat my feelings. Remembering my sister lived by this great sushi place with a reverse Happy Hour, we decided to meet at Yummy Grill & Sushi.Immediately entering, I was greeted with ""Moshi, moshi"" by all of the staff and sat down with my sister.  Immediately a server came over, greeted us, took our drink orders, and handed us menus. We ordered the garlic edamame; the MOST delicious stuff, ever. I ordered a second round. I wanted to lick the extra sauce left over in it. I also had a bowl of their Miso Soup, excellent as well. Let's get to the sushi. Since it was happy hour (4 PM - 6 PM Sunday through Thursday/ 10 PM - 1 AM everyday),  rolls are priced as low as $2. All happy hour sushi contains 4 pieces and they aren't extra small pieces either. Our drinks arrived with a free portion of their veggie pancake. It had a nice, delicate flavor. We ordered the spicy tuna roll and avocado on top twice (if you've never tried this, do, it's heaven) and they didn't charge me extra (how RARE is that). The shrimp tempura crunch roll was divine, we ordered that twice as well. My sister got an eel roll, which she loved (I love eel sauce, just can't handle the texture. I tried it, it tasted amazing, but let her finish it). We order a Philly roll, which was yummy, you can't go wrong with creme cheese, salmon, and avocado. I especially like that it was fresh salmon. Some sushi places use salmon that has that smokey taste to it and it just ruins it for me. The garlic albacore came with the garlic sauce on the side; the sauce was so good I wanted to spoon the rest of little bowl of it like soup. The Japanese Lasagna was also AMAZING! Warm and perfect. My sister and I had about 7/8 rolls, 2 orders of that garlic edamane, and miso soup, total damage: $41 and change and we were stuffed to the gills! Our server was very attentive and answered all of my silly questions (and trust me, I have a lot of them). This particular night they had a lot of fresh seafood options, the board read: O'Toro, Blu fin Tuna from Spain, Nodokuro, Sayori, Live Uni, Scallos, Octopus Legs, Abalone, and Lobster. They have a variety of non-sushi dishes from a variety of Asian cultures. The place is small, but has a family like feel.This may be the best sushi I've ever had in Vegas and that's a huge statement because I am super, duper picky. Well done, Yummy Grill. Can't wait to go back!"

I'm 6'4"" and I get ""Do you play for the Cardinals?"" a lot, so I'm sure that when the proprietors see me darken the door of their establishment they're all like ""ohsh*t."" Fear not, lil Asian lady, for I am not a glutton. I'm here for the seafood and the sushi and some green tea.As far as the sushi selection goes, it beats anything AYCE in the Valley that I've seen. There were at least 20 types of rolls and it wasn't just surimi crab and tempura, either. The tuna and salmon and snapper nigiri were really good, too.If you have room for some fried rice, this one is delicious and so are the Chinese sausages and grilled chicken. Even the raw oysters were good, and that has never happened to me in AZ before.Service was pleasant, and from the way it's decorated, I'm guessing this was once a Claim Jumper. Anyhow, it's a huge restaurant with a huge selection of items and if you're a vegetarian, you will be in heaven here with more vegetarian offerings than I've ever seen at a buffet. Seaweed is a vegetable, isn't it?"

Not fatty, real rotisserie style meat, guacamole sauce, cebollitas y jalapeno on the grill. A+++ The only train they don't get 5 on it is because their set up sucks, and it takes like 45 min standing in line, and you stand in different lines for different meat. stand in line for specific meat, then go pay and get your cup, and finish off with your beverage. I also had the fries with asada...good fries, but the asada was like a B. All that being said, this will be added to my Vegas eatery rotation every time i visit. 4 tacos de asada con todo porfa...."
